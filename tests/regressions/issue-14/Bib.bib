  abstract = {Design-based research studies are conducted as iterative implementation- analysis-modification cycles, in which emerging theoretical models and pedagogically plausible activities are reciprocally tuned toward each other as a means of investigating conjectures pertaining to mechanisms underlying content teaching and learning. Yet this approach, even when resulting in empirically effective educational products, remains under- conceptualized as long as researchers cannot be explicit about their craft and specifically how data analyses inform design decisions. Consequentially, design decisions may appear arbitrary, design methodology is insufficiently documented for broad dissemination, and design practice is inadequately conversant with learning-sciences perspectives. One reason for this apparent under-theorizing, I propose, is that designers do not have appropriate constructs to formulate and reflect on their own intuitive responses to students' observed interactions with the media under development. Recent socio-cultural explication of epistemic artifacts as semiotic means for mathematical learners to objectify presymbolic notions (e.g., Radford, Mathematical Thinking and Learning 5(1): 37-70, 2003) may offer design-based researchers intellectual perspectives and analytic tools for theorizing design improvements as responses to participants' compromised attempts to build and communi- cate meaning with available media. By explaining these media as potential semiotic means for students to objectify their emerging understandings of mathematical ideas, designers, reciprocally, create semiotic means to objectify their own intuitive design decisions, as they build and improve these media. Examining three case studies of undergraduate students reasoning about a simple probability situation (binomial), I demonstrate how the semiotic approach illuminates the process and content of student reasoning and, so doing, explicates and possibly enhances design-based research methodology.},

These challenges are typically caused by the inability of students to construct a mental image of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a drug molecule from its two-dimensional presentations. This study explores a prototype virtual reality (VR) gamification option, as an educational tool developed to aid the learning process and to improve the delivery of the MC subject to students. The developed system is evaluated by a cohort of 41 students. The analysis of the results was encouraging and provided invaluable feedback for the future development of the proposed system.},

The acquisition of discoursive oral language skills for applied authentic contexts is challenging for group-based classroom settings and is often outsourced to autonomous analogue tandem learning. We operationalise a Digital Game-Based Language Learning (DGBLL) approach for distance learning, which relieves tandems from overstraining autonomy and self-guidance.               Hololingo!               supports tandems in their learning activities by providing entertaining communicative, collaborative, and didactically designed team tasks. These are embedded in a narrative adventure, target linguistic phenomena, and support the holistic acquisition of oral discourse competencies and fluency. The combination of the tandem principle, immersive Social VR gamification, barrier-free access to a global pool of expert/native speakers, and a curricular connection through task selection facilitates language learning and provides transcultural contacts. App development follows a Design-Based-Research cycle of conception, implementation, and evaluation. The results of a qualitative discourse analysis of the learning interaction are discussed with regard to tandem role behaviour, the relation between task design and communication as well as affective and creative behaviour.},

Secondly, Cyanobacteria play significant roles in distressing the biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, minerals and microbes; thirdly, they can be used either as axenic cultures or as mixed cultures both offering distinct advantages. Lastly, some species are tolerant towards extreme temperatures both low and high, acidic pH, high salt concentrations and heavy metals, which makes them outstanding candidates for the wastewater treatment plants. The suitable immobilization methods must evolve, better understanding of their morphological and biochemical parameters is required for the optimum growth, easy methods of harvesting the biomass after the treatment are required and more trials on large-scale basis are required before they can be launched on full-fledged basis for wastewater treatments.},

An educational virtual reality game (Ke{\c s}fet Kurtul) was developed for the study. Dur-ing the development of the game, the ideas of experts were utilized and flow theo-ry was taken into account. The educational virtual reality game was developed in the light of the flow theory. The research was carried out in a school in Samsun with 4th grade pupils. The game was evaluated by the pupils in terms of overall evaluation, challenge-skills balance, concentration on the task, clear goals, sense of control, action-awareness merging, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time, unambiguous feedback and autotelic experience. As a result, the educa-tional virtual reality game Ke{\c s}fet Kurtul is a digital learning environment that pu-pils enjoyed a lot. It has been determined that all tasks except the "radio" task, and in general the game itself, provide flow experience. It is proposed to redesign just one task of the game in terms of challenge-skills balance and clear goals. It's sug-gested that in experimental studies, different variables can be examined.},

  abstract = {This is an excellent overview of the pros and cons of surgical VR techniques. In the Netherlands, it is concluded that training scenarios for complicated endoscopic procedures are lacking. A cultural shift in the teaching hospitals is thus needed both for trainers and trainees.[94] The authors also focus on the fact that so far it has not been proven that a virtual environment can improve neurosurgical training. The question ``Why is that so?'' is not fully answered! Limited dexterity will result in neurosurgical trainees not developing their skills to an extent that will convert them from novices into experienced surgeons.[89--91] Most importantly, however, all surgeons need to be able to reflect over how they are performing during operative procedures if they are to become true experts.[92] Moving into the topic ``endoscopic surgery,'' we also change our working space in many ways.[88] Most importantly, we change our normal working 3D space into a 2D space. Thereby we have to learn new ways of obtaining a 3D perception. Most literature on surgical VR techniques is dealing with multi-port endoscopy, where surgeons are working in an artificial, distended operative field. This is in contrast to neurosurgery, where only one endoscopic port is used. Models of removing gall bladders were among the first VR scenarios. While training with VR-simulators, there is a significant difference in the number of mistakes and speed between experienced and novice surgeons.[87] This fact cannot simply be transfered to the learning of endoscopy in neurosurgery. In endoscopic neurosurgery, using a single endoscope to both view and manipulate instruments in narrow spaces under the brain with very limited degrees of finger/hand movements makes a significant difference.[89] In real surgical life, sensing is a key point for neurosurgeons. For spatio/temporal skills, using the sense of touch is an important skill to learn and master. For technical reasons, haptics are most often not included in the VR systems on the market.[95] Verbal teaching of haptics is a challenging task. The range of haptic sensitivity varies from person to person, and possibly also from dominant to non-dominant hand in the same person. Bring a brain retractor into the field and demonstrate to your trainee how gentle your retraction of the brain is. How can the trainee sense what you are doing?[89,93] To the best of my knowledge, the topic of ``how to learn to use a brain spatula'' has never been introduced in neurosurgical training, not even in the present paper.No one mentions the fact that the trainee learns only how to use a spatula by watching his mentor in no way can the pressure-sensing of the spatula on the brain be transferred from trainer to trainee in the present operating room situations. We have therefore developed a Virtual Brain model using haptic feedback to develop different pressures of the retractor, and thus different deformations of the brain.[93] Now we can teach trainees how the true pressure equals the monitored pressure and the brain shape/deformations are correlated.[86] The neurosurgical VR training is thus different from training in conventional multi-port endoscopy. Neurosurgeons have to use VR systems that develop dexterity and transfer it into an automatic dexterity, whereby haptics are needed in the coming neurosurgical VR models.},

In this article, we present evidence drawn from teachers' and learners' gestures to make the case that mathematical knowledge is embodied. We argue that mathematical cognition is embodied in 2 key senses: It is based in perception and action, and it is grounded in the physical environment. We present evidence for each of these claims drawn from the gestures that teachers and learners produce when they explain mathematical concepts and ideas. We argue that (a) pointing gestures reflect the grounding of cognition in the physical environment, (b) representational gestures manifest mental simulations of action and perception, and (c) some metaphoric gestures reflect body-based conceptual metaphors. Thus, gestures reveal that some aspects of mathematical thinking are embodied.},

  abstract = {1. These pure culture studies show the conditions most favorable for growth and nitrogen fixation by the common blue-green alga, Nostoc muscorum Ag., previously isolated from soil, freed from other organisms, and its nitrogen-fixing ability demonstrated. A detailed morphological description of the organism is given. 2. The organism readily obtains both its nitrogen and carbon from the air. Its rate of growth and nitrogen fixation is ten- to twenty-fold greater than that previously reported for other nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. The quantity of nitrogen fixed is as high as 10 mg. N in 45 days and 18 mg. N in 85 days per 100 cc. of a medium containing no carbohydrate. 3. When kept in the dark in a medium containing glucose, normal appearing chlorophyll forms and growth and nitrogen fixation proceed slowly. A fixation of 10 to 12 mg. N per gram of glucose consumed is common under these conditions. 4. The organism thrives in a variety of media, provided the pH is satisfactory. The lower and upper limits of growth are approximately 5.7 and 9.0, respectively, while the optimum covers the range of about 7.0 to 8.5. 5. A medium containing the usual inorganic salts, without carbonates and sugar, and with K2HPO4 as a buffer, is satisfactory for use in unaerated cultures. Growth and nitrogen fixation are much more rapid if the medium is aerated, preferably with air containing about 1 per cent CO2. The addition of sugars increases the rate of growth of both aerated and unaerated cultures, especially the latter; likewise combined nitrogen, such as nitrates, ammonia, and asparagin, is usually used somewhat more rapidly than is free nitrogen gas. 6. In unaerated liquid cultures containing an abundance of carbonates and exposed to a high light intensity, the pH rises to about 9.6 and most of the cells die. This results from the utilization of the carbonates as a source of CO2 when neither adequate CO2 gas nor sugar is supplied. 7. A light intensity of 175 to 350 foot candles from Mazda lamps gives satisfactory results. A 12-hour day is somewhat preferable to continuous illumination except at the lower light intensities. 8. Neither calcium nor strontium, at least in concentrations greater than traces, is necessary for growth in the presence of combined nitrogen. In a nitrogen-free medium nitrogen fixation markedly decreases in their absence, however, suggesting that they play a catalytic role in nitrogen fixation, as in the case of Azotobacter. Natural humic acid increases growth and nitrogen fixation, probably due chiefly to its content of available iron. Boron and manganese have no appreciable beneficial effect. 9. These studies indicate that Nostoc muscorum is an organism of considerable importance in soils and possibly in fresh ponds and lakes, adding both nitrogen and organic matter to its growth medium. A brief general discussion of the economic importance of the Myxophyceae in soils is given.},

  abstract = {Objective. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills are lifesaving skills, the gap between awareness and actual training remains significant. Advances in technology are shaping the future of education and innovative learning solutions are essential to facilitate effective and accessible training. This project objective is to develop a self-directed educational system for hands-on CPR training using virtual reality (VR) technology.             Methods. HTC VIVE was the chosen VR engine, and Unity3D was the software used for development. CPR skills including chest compressions, rescue breathing, and automated external defibrillator (AED) are taught in VR through focused instructions, demonstrations, and simulated interactive scenarios with hands-on training sessions. A tracking system was designed using virtual planes and VIVE-Tracker for accurate measurements of chest compressions (rate, depth, and recoil), hands' position and AED. A real mannequin was integrated in the VR space and overlaid with virtual 3D-human model for realistic haptic feedback and hands-on training. VIVE-controller was used for precise calibration between the mannequin location in real environment and the virtual human model in VR space.             Results. The VR-CPR prototype was designed to be generic, approachable, and easy to follow. Realism and interaction were achieved through 3D virtual scenes simulating common sites at which cardiac arrest may occur. Variety in scenarios and gamification features like scoring and difficulty levels of training were made to enhance users' engagement. The VR-mannequin hybrid system enabled quality training and immersive learning experience. Further, real-time feedback and scoring system are built for self-directed learning and optimal performance.             Conclusions. The developed VR-hybrid product is a structured educational tool for hands-on CPR training and ongoing practice. This innovative technology provides self-directed learning with no restrictions of time, place, or personnel, which are the main challenges with current traditional courses. This product is a promising CPR training initiative in the evolution of digital education.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Gamification is the application of game features, mainly video game elements, into non-game context for the purpose of promoting motivation and engagement in learning. The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners' motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Themes covered in the literature review include: conceptualizing gamification, advantages of gamification over game-based learning, theoretical connections to gamification, motivation and engagement, connecting gamification to motivation and engagement, emotions and fun in gamification, player types and gamification features, gamification in action, and implementation guidelines.                                         Findings               The literature on the effect of gamification on motivation and gamification is still limited on multiple levels. There is a gap between theory and practice in the study of gamification. There is limited literature on the implementation guidelines of the gamified designs.                                         Practical implications               This critical analysis of literature is followed by connecting it to future research by the same author as part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. The second project, will be proposing a methodology for any successful design to provide a holistic understanding of the topic of gamification. Finally, an empirical study on the effect of gamification on students' motivation and engagement in three college courses will be submitted to complete the trilogy.                                         Originality/value               This paper is a literature review, so there is a strong connection to literature on this topic. However, the synthesis of the themes and ideas are original. The literature review is extensive and covers the different aspects of the topic of gamification and its relationship to motivation and engagement.},

  abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate)/graphite (PET/G) micro-composites were fabricated by the melt compounding method using a minilab extruder. The carbon fillers were found to act as nucleating agents for the PET matrix and hence accelerated crystallization and increased the degree of crystallinity. TGA showed that carbon fillers improved the resistance to thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation under both air and nitrogen atmospheres. However, a poor agreement was observed at higher loadings of the filler where the composites displayed reduced reinforcement efficiency. The results demonstrate that the addition of graphite at loading {$>$}14.5 wt.\% made electrically conductive composites. It was calculated that the electric conductivities of PET/graphite micro-composites were enhanced, above the percolation threshold values by two orders of magnitudes compared to the PET matrix. The minimum value of conductivity required to avoid electrostatic charge application of an insulating polymer was achieved, just above the threshold values. The addition of graphite also improved thermal stability of PET, accelerated its crystallization process and increased the degree of crystallinity. Microscopic results exhibit no indication of aggregations at 2 wt.\% graphite, whereas more agglomeration and rolling up could be seen as the graphite content was increased in the PET matrix (in particular, above the percolation threshold value). Furthermore, based on the mechanical experimental characterization of the PET/graphite micro-composites, a large deformation-based mathematical model is proposed for material behavior predictions. The model fits well the experimental data and predicts other mechanical data that are not included in the parameter identification.},

  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world's forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11 923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types---tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age {$<$} 100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.},

In fact, a growing number of researches concerning virtual reality and gamification and its applications to this area have been published since 2012. Following this pathway, this research aims to identify and propose practical applications of virtual reality and gamification in higher education environments, which can contribute with a positive input to students' engagement and motivation towards their learning and academic activities. To do so, we employed a mixed research technique (qualitative and quantitative) in this research, collecting data from first year students and faculty staff at Higher Education Institutions (HEI). The collected data will then be processed and analyzed using specific software tools (MAXQDA and SPSS). With this research we pretend to put in evidence that an enormous pathway is here to be uncovered, which may expose virtual reality a gamification as contributors of creating stimuli that enhance students' experiences from the learning environments, and in result may lead to influence decision-making to actual and prospective students' intentions.},

At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to gamification (               P               {$>$} 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active participation for a ``fun learning'' experience supported by numerous positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam results were better than the cohort's average (               P               {$<$} 0.05), suggesting that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first and foremost, that it is tutor dependent. Taken together, gamification could represent a new paradigm for anatomy education, and also an opportune time to change the prevailing culture in the healthcare and education industry. Clin.

As a result of this, majority of the people in the most endemic areas suffer from dental fluorosis, a problem that greatly affects their confidence when they move out of the district to other places. In finding a sustainable and cost effective solution to reducing the fluoride content of their underground waters before being used, a solar water distillation unit was built using local materials from Anaafobiisi. Results from test conducted on the purified water from the solar distiller showed a significant reduction in the levels of fluoride in the water. From an initial concentration of 20.6 mg/l of fluoride in the water from a local borehole, this was reduced to an average of about 0.7 mg/l which is below the WHO acceptable limit for fluoride in drinking water when the solar distillation unit was used to purify it. The solar distillation unit when installed as a decentralised system is an effective means of reducing the high fluoride contamination making the water safe for drinking.},

This performative autoethnographic method provided creative freedom and the satisfaction of a renewed perspective for the author (Jay and Johnson 2002). This primary qualitative data was given legitimacy and structure by the use of thematic analysis as a methodology. The findings support Bochner's (1994) idea that social science research can benefit from deliberately value-laden stories alongside empirical data and theories. The findings also developed the author's previous autoethnographic paper, which drew on his own social media posts as qualitative and quantitative data Atherton (2020b).},

  abstract = {Grape pomace (pulp and skins) was investigated as a new biosorbent for removing mycotoxins from liquid media. In vitro adsorption experiments showed that the pomace obtained from Primitivo grapes is able to sequester rapidly and simultaneously different mycotoxins. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was the most adsorbed mycotoxin followed by zearalenone (ZEA), ochratoxin A (OTA), and fumonisin B1 (FB1), whereas the adsorption of deoxynivalenol (DON) was negligible. AFB1 and ZEA adsorptions were not affected by changing pH values in the pH 3-8 range, whereas OTA and FB1 adsorptions were significantly affected by pH. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms obtained at different temperatures (5-70 {$^\circ$}C) and pH values (3 and 7) were modeled and evaluated using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Sips, and Hill models. The goodness of the fits and the parameters involved in the adsorption mechanism were calculated by the nonlinear regression analysis method. The best-fitting models to describe AFB1, ZEA, and OTA adsorption by grape pomace were the Sips, Langmuir, and Freundlich models, respectively. The Langmuir and Sips models were the best models for FB1 adsorption at pH 7 and 3, respectively. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacities (mmol/kg dried pomace) calculated at pH 7 and 3 decreased in the following order: AFB1 (15.0 and 15.1) {$>$} ZEA (8.6 and 8.3) {$>$} OTA (6.3-6.9) {$>$} FB1 (2.2 and 0.4). Single- and multi-mycotoxin adsorption isotherms showed that toxin adsorption is not affected by the simultaneous presence of different mycotoxins in the liquid medium. The profiles of adsorption isotherms obtained at different temperatures and pH and the thermodynamic parameters ({$\Delta$}G{$^\circ$}, {$\Delta$}H{$^\circ$}, {$\Delta$}S{$^\circ$}) suggest that mycotoxin adsorption is an exothermic and spontaneous process, which involves physisorption weak associations. Hydrophobic interactions may be associated with AFB1 and ZEA adsorption, whereas polar noncovalent interactions may be associated with OTA and FB1 adsorption. In conclusion, this study suggests that biosorption of mycotoxins onto grape pomace may be a reasonably low-cost decontamination method.},

  abstract = {Programming is one of the most required skills set in today's IT world. Students find it difficult to learn complex programming structure with different syntax. In general, they can learn through online courses or by using books. However, sometimes, it shuttles the thrust of learning programming as it follows some traditional methodologies and it is true that there is no innovative or interesting way to learn programming conceptually. Hence, an interactive and gamified mode of learning is essential and has been developed using unity 3D. As a result of the transition from the Information Age to the Experience Age, educators face significant challenges. Students, for example, are passive and disengaged, and they might even struggle to see the significance of what they are learning to their existences; additionally, important skills required for 21st century learners -- such as empathy, organizational theory, creativity, supercomputing literacy, and analytical thinking -- are difficult to teach. Virtual reality, as an immersive, hands-on learning tool, has the potential to play a distinctive role in meeting these educational challenges. In this paper, we show how the attributes of virtual reality can lead to new possibilities for learners. We wrap up by discussing suggestions and next steps.}

Concerns were raised about the clarity and comprehensiveness of definitions, particularly regarding their applicability to qualitative and human-centered research. Most participants acknowledged a~Replication Crisis in SE. They identified several challenges contributing to the failure to achieve reproducibility, including the lack of clear guidelines,~selective reporting, and pressure to publish. Respondents highlighted negative factors, such as insufficient protocols and data availability, while positive~factors included professional incentives and a call for cultural changes emphasizing quality over quantity in research output.Conclusion: Although most researchers recognize the existence of a Replication Crisis in SE, a portion remains uncertain about its impact. The study~identifies critical areas for improvement, including improving transparency,~adopting rigorous reporting standards, and fostering a culture that values~reproducibility and research quality.

Scaling the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and NIRV from FLUXNET eddy covariance sites, we estimate global annual terrestrial photosynthesis to be 147 Pg C/year (95\% credible interval 131-163 Pg C/year), which falls between bottom-up GPP estimates and the top-down global constraint on GPP from oxygen isotopes. NIRV -derived estimates of GPP are systematically higher than existing bottom-up estimates, especially throughout the midlatitudes. Progress in improving estimated GPP from NIRV can come from improved cloud screening in satellite data and increased resolution of vegetation characteristics, especially details about plant photosynthetic pathway.},

In two studies, we utilized a state-of-the-art, image-based tele-immersive system, capable of tracking and rendering many degrees of freedom of human motion in real time. In Experiment 1, participants learned better in VR than in a video learning condition according to self-report measures, and the cause of the advantage was seeing one's avatar stereoscopically in the third person. In Experiment 2, we added a virtual mirror in the learning environment to further leverage the ability to see oneself from novel angles in real time.

Anaerobic digestion is a rising and prominent solution, but this technology still generates highly concentrated effluent that requires further remediation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of cultivating the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis in swine effluent for future applications in biological waste treatment and value-added fermentation. To accomplish this goal, growth of S.~platensis was characterized in varying proportions of ideal, synthetic Zarrouk medium and anaerobically digested pig effluent (ADPE) to obtain growth rate models. Results yielded a positive correlation between S.~platensis growth rate and Zarrouk medium proportion, with the highest growth rate in 100\% Zarrouk media but comparable growth in the 50/50\% Zarrouk/ADPE mixture. This study demonstrates the potential for S.~platensis to further improve the treatment efficacy of anaerobic digestion systems, and the exploratory analysis also highlights that further testing is required to investigate possible carbon availability, chemical inhibition, and overall nutrient reduction in ADPE. This research contributes important data toward the feasibility of producing value-added cyanobacterial biomass while simultaneously consuming excess nutrients to aid in agricultural wastewater management efforts and generate cost-effective products in a more sustainable manner.},

Such embodiment results in a perceptual illusion of body ownership over the virtual body (VB). Previous research has shown that the form of the VB can influence implicit attitudes. In particular, embodying White people in a Black virtual body is associated with an immediate decrease in their implicit racial bias against Black people. We tested whether the reduction in implicit bias lasts for at least one week and whether it is enhanced by multiple exposures. Two experiments were carried out with a total of 90 female participants where the virtual body was either Black or White. Participants were required to follow a virtual Tai Chi teacher who was either Asian or European Caucasian. Each participant had 1, 2 or 3 exposures separated by days. Implicit racial bias was measured one week before their first exposure and one week after their last. The results show that implicit bias decreased more for those with the Black virtual body than the White. There was also some evidence of a general decrease in bias independently of body type for which possible explanations are put forward.},

Prior to this study, we completed a first cycle of design revisions to a game-based ecological sciences curriculum to make more apparent specific domain concepts associated with targeted learning standards. Of particular interest was using gaming principles to embed standards-based science concepts in the curricular experience without undermining the situative embodiment central to our design philosophy. In Study One reported here, the same first-cycle elementary teacher used the refined second-cycle curriculum, again with high-ability fourth graders. We then analyzed qualitative and quantitative data on student participation and performance to further refine our theory and revise the curriculum. In Study Two, another teacher implemented a further refined second-cycle curriculum with lower achieving fourth graders, including several students labeled as having special needs. We use the design trajectory and results to illustrate and warrant the creation of a situationally embodied curriculum that supports the learning of specific disciplinary formalisms.  {\copyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

I contend that reproducibility engenders trust, which we routinely build in community via conversations, and the practices of open source software help us to learn how to be more effective learning (discovering) together, contributing to the same goal.},

  abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statis- tics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement record- ing systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The stor- age and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components - not at the level of holistic perceptual expe- riences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a com- mon frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspec- tion (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and ab- stract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinato- rially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a per- ceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal sym- bol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

Even when dinitrogen gas is the most abundant form of N, it can only be used by fixing bacteria but is inaccessible to most organisms, algae among them. Algae preferentially use ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) for growth, and the reactions for their conversion into amino acids (N assimilation) constitute an important part of the nitrogen cycle by primary producers. Recently, it was claimed that algae are also involved in denitrification, because of the production of nitric oxide (NO), a signal molecule, which is also a substrate of NO reductases to produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. This review is focused on the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as an algal model and its participation in different reactions of the N cycle. Emphasis will be paid to new actors, such as putative genes involved in NO and N2O production and their occurrence in other algae genomes. Furthermore, algae/bacteria mutualism will be considered in terms of expanding the N cycle to ammonification and N fixation, which are based on the exchange of carbon and nitrogen between the two organisms.},

  abstract = {Grape is the main fruit crop in several countries. Although many grape-based food products can be found in the market, studies have shown that around 75\% of the world grape production is destined for the wine industry. Grape pomace is an abundant by-product from the wine industry, which consists of the remaining skin, seeds and stalks and represents around 25\% of total grape weight used in the winemaking process. In countries such as Italy, France and Spain, where wine production is more relevant, the annual grape pomace generation can reach nearly 1200 tonnes per year. In order to reach a sustainable winemaking process there is a need of a waste reduction policy. Several studies explore this subject using grape pomace as a source of healthy and technological compounds that could be applied in animal feed, pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food industry to improve stability and nutritional characteristics, and in cosmetic industry, where grape seeds oil is widely used. This review aims to approach the recent winemaking scenario and the benefits achieved when a waste management policy is implemented, as well as to compare available extractive technologies and a wide alternative of uses for grape pomace.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews empirically grounded research on practices in game development with the intent to give a comprehensive overview of contemporary development practices used in the video game industry. While there are many intangible elements that inform game development processes, this review specifically covers the more immediate practical challenges. The review covers a total of 48 papers published between 2006 and 2016, which were all subjected to thematic analysis by three reviewers. The results of the review show that an almost universal characteristic of game development is that it is almost impossible to accurately plan a development project in detail, largely due to the soft requirements inherent in game production which emerge mid-process during development projects, during when testing is coupled with continuous ideation and refinement. Practicing game developers have created their own frameworks that accommodate for this lack of planning. They include flat hierarchies, democratic decision-making, creative autonomy, and informal communication, which are designed to create an environment that maintains creativity and openness to product changes long into the production process. These frameworks vary significantly between studios and often between individual projects. This review also shows that the term `Agile', while often used by both researchers and developers to characterize the process of game development, is not an apt descriptor of how game developers actually work. Agile is used as shorthand for unstructured and flexible development, rather than serving as a descriptor of a definable or unified work method. Finally, as companies develop more complicated hierarchies of stakeholders and staff, the desired flexibility and autonomy of game development becomes increasingly complicated to maintain, and often necessitates more formalized management processes and company structures. In these cases, inherent tensions of game development become more pronounced, and continuous creativity is hard to maintain due to a growing need to formalize processes.},

The features studied were: Gaze (the musicians ignored the participant, the musicians sometimes looked towards and followed the participant's movements), Sound Spatialization (Mono, Stereo, Spatial), Auralization (no sound reflections, reflections corresponding to a room larger than the one perceived, reflections that exactly matched the virtual room), and Environment (no sound from outside of the room, birdsong and wind corresponding to the outside scene). We adopted the methodology based on color matching theory, where 20 participants were first able to assess their feeling of plausibility in the environment with each of the four features at their highest setting. Then five times participants started from a low setting on all features and were able to make transitions from one system configuration to another until they matched their original feeling of plausibility. From these transitions a Markov transition matrix was constructed, and also probabilities of a match conditional on feature configuration. The results show that Environment and Gaze were individually the most important factors influencing the level of plausibility. The highest probability transitions were to improve Environment and Gaze, and then Auralization and Spatialization. We present this work as both a contribution to the methodology of assessing presence without questionnaires, and showing how various aspects of a musical performance can influence plausibility.},

Empathy enables us to learn from others' pain and to know when to offer support. Similarly, virtual reality (VR) appears to allow individuals to step into someone else's shoes, through a perceptual illusion called embodiment, or the body ownership illusion. Considering these perspectives, we propose a theoretical analysis of different mechanisms of empathic practices in order to define a possible framework for the design of empathic training in VR. This is not intended to be an extensive review of all types of practices, but an exploration of empathy and empathy-related phenomena. Empathy-related training practices are analyzed and categorized. We also identify different variables used by pioneer studies in VR to promote empathy-related responses. Finally, we propose strategies for using embodied VR technology to train specific empathy-related abilities.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that immersive virtual reality environments such as those achievable through the head-mounted displays, enhance task performance in online engineering design activities. In this paper, task performance is measured by the time to complete a given engineering activity. Over the last decade, a wide range of virtual reality applications have been developed based on non-immersive and immersive virtual reality systems for educational purposes. However, a major limitation of non-immersive virtual reality systems is the lack of an immersive experience that not only provides content to students, but also enables them to interact and learn in a completely 360 degree immersive environment. The authors of this work have developed a replica of a physical engineering laboratory in an interactive virtual learning environment. This research measures the difference in task performance between i) students exposed to an immersive virtual reality system and ii) students exposed to a non-immersive virtual reality system, in the interactive virtual environment developed by the research team. This research seeks to explore whether statistically significant differences in performance exist between these groups. Knowledge gained from testing this hypothesis will inform educators about the value and impact of immersive virtual reality technologies in enhancing online education. A case study involving 54 students in a product functional analysis task is used to test the hypothesis.},

It uses 3D object tracking, real time graphics, and surround-sound to enhance learning. We present two studies from the earth science domain that address questions regarding the feasibility and efficacy of SMALLab in a classroom context. We present data demonstrating that students learn more during a recent SMALLab intervention compared to regular classroom instruction. We contend that well-designed, mixed-reality environments have much to offer STEM learners, and that the learning gains transcend those that can be expected from more traditional classroom procedures. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Streams represent active components of the carbon cycle as emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane to the atmosphere at a global scale. However, the mechanisms and governing factors of these emissions are still largely unknown, especially concerning the effect of land use. We compared dissolved and gaseous carbon dynamics in streams bordered by contrasting types of land use, specifically agriculture and forest. Carbon dioxide and methane partial pressures (pCO2 and pCH4, respectively) in the water body and carbon emissions via both gases were studied for 24 h during four field expeditions. pCH4 did not differ between the two system types. pCO2 was constantly oversaturated in all streams and significantly higher in agricultural streams (annual mean 4282 ppm) compared to forest streams (annual mean 2189 ppm) during all seasons. However, emissions of CO2 were not significantly different between the stream types due to significantly higher gas transfer velocity in forest compared to agricultural streams. pCO2 was significantly positively correlated to the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus in the water. Furthermore, pCO2 was correlated to optical parameters of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, e.g., it increased with indicators of molecular size and an allochthonous fluorescent component identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). This study demonstrates that different forms of land use may trigger a cascade of effects on the carbon production and emission of streams linked to changes in DOM quality.},

After game completion, the participants completed a 10-item survey measuring elements of flow and a 12-item survey designed to measure perceptions toward learning with VR games, immersion and presence. Participant focus groups were conducted with an emphasis on features that promoted engagement, learning, immersion, and presence. The findings revealed that all students experienced a flow state when they played the iVR learning game. Almost all users (98.1\%) had positive attitudes towards using the iVR game. Students experienced high immersion and presence. In addition, students had favorable attitudes towards learning with iVR games in school environments.},

  abstract = {When monitoring the long history of empirical instruments for environmental attitude measurement, the Two Major Environmental Value model (2-MEV) with its two higher order factors: Preservation (PRE) and Utilization (UTL) has repeatedly and independently been confirmed. PRE assesses preferences towards conservation of nature and the environment, whilst UTL measures preferences towards utilization/exploitation of nature. The latter, however, does not yet include the positive aspects of benefitting from the (enjoyable) use of nature. Consequently, besides the established 2-MEV-battery, additional items from an ``Appreciation of Nature'' (APR) scale were applied to an Irish sample of 289 secondary school students (age: M = 14.3 years). Responses to the altogether 30-item battery were applied on an oblique rotation by using the Promax procedure: UTL and PRE appeared as orthogonally related factors, APR correlated to PRE with 0.283. Based on loading scores, the item number for each subscale was further reduced to make the analysis more manageable in educational outreach sites; on those sites, where completing questionnaires may well be quite unpopular, they are very much needed for planning and fine-tuning educational programs. Therefore, extending the 2-MEV scale with an added scale for Appreciation may help: (i) to judge participants' feedback for adjusting/balancing program contents better; and (ii) to promote appreciation as a successful strategy for shifting individuals away from their individual exploitative preferences.},

Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

In this systematic review, we aimed to verify which pro-environmental information, attitudes, and behaviors are targeted by serious games and gamified apps, how their efficiency is tested, and the main results. A total of 29 studies were included in the analysis. The results show that serious games and apps were used to decrease energy consumption, water spending, and food consumption, and increase sustainable mobility. Furthermore, technology was used to offer pro-environmental education regarding a myriad of issues. Most interventions were successful and some of them did have significant effects while others provided only short-term changes. The limitations of the current approaches are discussed together with some future expansions that can help develop more efficiency in this domain.},

  abstract = {Universities, with their complex systems, influence on local economies and socio-cultural place-making, serve as a framework for the sustainable development (SD) transformation within communities. In support of Germany's Energy Transition and the goal of climate neutral state governance by 2040, the state of Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg selected seven universities to create real-world lab projects addressing various sustainability-related themes. This paper presents a case study of the University of Applied Sciences (HFT) Stuttgart's EnSign real-world lab, which employs transdisciplinary research methods to find transferable solutions for the transition to a climate neutral inner-city campus. EnSign's approach includes the development of an iterative, optimization-based, knowledge capture process that is inclusive of both external and internal stakeholders. Goals are to catalyze the campus transition, adjust user behavior, and increase energy efficiency by developing new building operating concepts, public building renovation financing models, stakeholder integration methods, and institutional management structures. A brief review of the supporting policy framework, theoretical foundations, and topical areas of implementation are presented. Initial findings are described with regard to communication strategies, civil society integration, and institutional preparedness for the transition. Conclusions reflect on the relevance for real-world lab experiments.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY                                This review summarizes recent aspects of (di)nitrogen fixation and (di)hydrogen metabolism, with emphasis on cyanobacteria. These organisms possess several types of the enzyme complexes catalyzing N                 2                 fixation and/or H                 2                 formation or oxidation, namely, two Mo nitrogenases, a V nitrogenase, and two hydrogenases. The two cyanobacterial Ni hydrogenases are differentiated as either uptake or bidirectional hydrogenases. The different forms of both the nitrogenases and hydrogenases are encoded by different sets of genes, and their organization on the chromosome can vary from one cyanobacterium to another. Factors regulating the expression of these genes are emerging from recent studies. New ideas on the potential physiological and ecological roles of nitrogenases and hydrogenases are presented. There is a renewed interest in exploiting cyanobacteria in solar energy conversion programs to generate H                 2                 as a source of combustible energy. To enhance the rates of H                 2                 production, the emphasis perhaps needs not to be on more efficient hydrogenases and nitrogenases or on the transfer of foreign enzymes into cyanobacteria. A likely better strategy is to exploit the use of radiant solar energy by the photosynthetic electron transport system to enhance the rates of H                 2                 formation and so improve the chances of utilizing cyanobacteria as a source for the generation of clean energy.},

  abstract = {The slime mould               Physarum polycephalum               , an aneural organism, uses information from previous experiences to adjust its behaviour, but the mechanisms by which this is accomplished remain unknown. This article examines the possible role of oscillations in learning and memory in slime moulds. Slime moulds share surprising similarities with the network of synaptic connections in animal brains. First, their topology derives from a network of interconnected, vein-like tubes in which signalling molecules are transported. Second, network motility, which generates slime mould behaviour, is driven by distinct oscillations that organize into spatio-temporal wave patterns. Likewise, neural activity in the brain is organized in a variety of oscillations characterized by different frequencies. Interestingly, the oscillating networks of slime moulds are not precursors of nervous systems but, rather, an alternative architecture. Here, we argue that comparable information-processing operations can be realized on different architectures sharing similar oscillatory properties. After describing learning abilities and oscillatory activities of               P. polycephalum               , we explore the relation between network oscillations and learning, and evaluate the organism's global architecture with respect to information-processing potential. We hypothesize that, as in the brain, modulation of spontaneous oscillations may sustain learning in slime mould.

  abstract = {Learning and memory are indisputably key features of animal success. Using information about past experiences is critical for optimal decision-making in a fluctuating environment. Those abilities are usually believed to be limited to organisms with a nervous system, precluding their existence in non-neural organisms. However, recent studies showed that the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, despite being unicellular, displays habituation, a simple form of learning. In this paper, we studied the possible substrate of both short- and long-term habituation in slime moulds. We habituated slime moulds to sodium, a known repellent, using a 6 day training and turned them into a dormant state named sclerotia. Those slime moulds were then revived and tested for habituation. We showed that information acquired during the training was preserved through the dormant stage as slime moulds still showed habituation after a one-month dormancy period. Chemical analyses indicated a continuous uptake of sodium during the process of habituation and showed that sodium was retained throughout the dormant stage. Lastly, we showed that memory inception via constrained absorption of sodium for 2 h elicited habituation. Our results suggest that slime moulds absorbed the repellent and used it as a `circulating memory'., This article is part of the theme issue `Liquid brains, solid brains: How distributed cognitive architectures process information'.},

In our virtual zoo exhibit, students can explore an accurate model of the gorilla habitat at Zoo Atlanta and access information related to the design of the exhibit. This paper discusses the design of the application and the interaction techniques used to obtain information. We also present the results of a formal evaluation. Although no statistically significant differences were found, results indicate that students who used the virtual environment had higher test scores than those who only attended a lecture on the material. Trends suggest that the virtual experience allowed students to learn information directly and also equipped them to better learn and understand material from a traditional lecture.},

We hypothesized that higher levels of immersion would benefit such tasks if the mental activity can be mapped to objects or locations in a 3D environment. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which participants memorized procedures in a virtual environment and then attempted to recall those procedures. We aimed to understand the effects of three components of immersion on performance. Results demonstrate that a matched software field of view (SFOV), a higher physical FOV, and a higher field of regard (FOR) all contributed to more effective memorization. The best performance was achieved with a matched SFOV and either a high FOV or a high FOR, or both. In addition, our experiment demonstrated that memorization in a virtual environment could be transferred to the real world. The results suggest that, for procedure memorization tasks, increasing the level of immersion even to moderate levels, such as those found in head-mounted displays (HMDs) and display walls, can improve performance significantly compared to lower levels of immersion.},

Photoautotrophs viz. cyanobacteria, micro-algae and macro-algae can photosynthetically assimilate the excessive pollutants present in the wastewater. The present review emphasizes on the achievability of microorganisms to bestow wastewater as the nutrient source for biomass production, which can further be reused for feed, food and fertilizers. To support this, various case studies have been cited that prove phycoremediation as a cost-effective and sustainable process over conventional wastewater treatment processes that requires high chemical load and more energy inputs.},

A `work in progress' account is then given of a project to develop two Web3D resources to enhance undergraduate tuition of the nervous system. Our approach is to support existing curricula using advanced modelling tools and a variety of delivery mechanisms. The first resource is a three-dimensional model of the adult brachial plexus: a network of nerves extending from the neck down to the shoulder, arm, hand, and fingers. This will be incorporated into existing didactic classroom teaching under the supervision of an anatomy teacher. The second resource is a piece of online courseware which will teach the embryological development of the brachial plexus. The delivery method will be the WebSET framework, a collaborative environment that allows a teacher to manipulate 3D models over the Web in real time whilst providing explanation and help to students. In this way the courseware can be used for both self-directed study and `virtual anatomy demonstrations' within an online peer group.},

This information is typically not consciously accessible, yet it provides an early sign that the speaker is ready to learn a particular task (S. Goldin-Meadow, 2003). In this sense, the unwitting gestures that speakers produce reveal their implicit knowledge. But what if a learner was forced to gesture? Would those elicited gestures also reveal implicit knowledge and, in so doing, enhance learning? To address these questions, the authors told children to gesture while explaining their solutions to novel math problems and examined the effect of this manipulation on the expression of implicit knowledge in gesture and on learning. The authors found that, when told to gesture, children who were unable to solve the math problems often added new and correct problem-solving strategies, expressed only in gesture, to their repertoires. The authors also found that when these children were given instruction on the math problems later, they were more likely to succeed on the problems than children told not to gesture. Telling children to gesture thus encourages them to convey previously unexpressed, implicit ideas, which, in turn, makes them receptive to instruction that leads to learning.},

They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

  abstract = {Do generative learning strategies influence the motivational and affective factors of learning with augmented reality? This article explores this highly topical new question in the field of research on educational technology and reports the results of a valueadded study that compares two mobile AR learning environments with or without additional learning strategies. A total of 56 primary school students participated and learned with augmented reality (AR) learning materials either in an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group learned with AR and additional learning strategies based on generative learning theory, namely, self-explanation and selftesting. The control group learned only with AR. It was investigated whether the addition of learning strategies would lead to a reduction in positive attitudes towards AR as a learning technology. The experimental group of students showed overall positive attitudes towards AR as a learning technology at approximately the same level as the control group. However, significant differences were found for the skepticism subscale, indicating that learners who learned with both AR and learning strategies were more skeptical about AR as a learning technology than those who learned only with AR. Gender differences were also found for the accessibility subscale, with male participants considering the AR technology to be easier to access outside of the classroom too. The impact of these results on theory and practice as well as further research directions is discussed.},

  abstract = {Research on the use of augmented reality (AR) in education has received a lot of attention in recent years. Based on many systematic reviews and meta-analyses, it has been concluded that AR is effective. Recently, however, researchers have criticized the fact that the empirical basis for this conclusion is based on results from methodologically problematic media comparison studies. However, an analysis of the literature and quantitative evidence for this claim are lacking. In this research project, this research gap was addressed using the Systematic Review method. A total of 92 primary studies from the top 12 Educational Technology journals were coded and analyzed. The results show that research on AR in education is based on media comparison studies: 80\% of the studies compare AR to another medium or technology. Few studies examine how and when learning with AR is effective. In addition, results show that over the years, since 2009, more media comparison studies have been published than other research types. We summarize why media comparison studies are problematic and discuss directions for future research on AR in education. This research shifts from the question if AR can be used in instruction to the more important questions of how and when learning and teaching with AR works.},

We supposed that the ability to spatially organize learning materials and working documents and collaborative spaces may stimulate creative thinking. In this method we applied the MaxWhere, an immersive virtual reality (iVR) system that gives wide range of possibilities for cooperative and collaborative work. This iVR system provides many means that can be used for activating cognitive processes and improving inventive thinking. This method provided positive results.},

However, mechanisms of N               2               O production by photosynthetic organisms are poorly described. Here we show that the green microalga               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               reduces NO into N               2               O using the photosynthetic electron transport. Through the study of               C. reinhardtii               mutants deficient in flavodiiron proteins (FLVs) or in a cytochrome p450 (CYP55), we show that FLVs contribute to NO reduction in the light, while CYP55 operates in the dark. Both pathways are active when NO is produced in vivo during the reduction of nitrites and participate in NO homeostasis. Furthermore, NO reduction by both pathways is restricted to chlorophytes, organisms particularly abundant in ocean N               2               O-producing hot spots. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of N               2               O production in eukaryotic phototrophs and represent an important step toward a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas emission by aquatic ecosystems.},

Furthermore, introductory courses are often taught with a traditional lecture style that is poor at engaging students. This study examines the impact of augmented reality (AR) field trip exercises on the interest levels of students using readily accessible mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) as a means to provide simulated field trip experiences to a larger number of learners. The results of this study, involving 874 students from five different institutions, show that students who completed three geospatially oriented Grand Canyon field trip game modules were significantly more interested in learning the geosciences than control students and participants who completed only one module. More comprehensively, results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate three strong predictors of student interest in learning the geosciences: (1) the student's initial interest, (2) being a STEM major, and (3) the number of AR field trip modules students complete. Notably, the race and gender of participants are not factors. Augmented reality field trips for mobile devices have potential to be an accessible and financially viable means to bring field trips to a diversity of students who would otherwise experience none. Results indicate these AR field trips increase student motivation to pursue geoscience learning.},

We studied potential causes for bird population changes based on data from standardised German breeding bird monitoring schemes. We related population trends to covariates describing the changes in the agricultural landscape in Germany, weather conditions during the breeding season and for some migratory species, conditions at stopover and wintering sites. Linear mixed effect models were used to analyse effect strength at species level and conclusions are drawn for the overall group of farmland bird species. The area of grassland and fallow land was shown to have the strongest positive effects and the area of maize and rapeseed the strongest negative effects on farmland bird population trends. The results obtained also indicate that despite the consistent influence of weather conditions during the breeding season, land-use changes had a stronger impact on bird populations than weather. Conditions at Sahel wintering sites did not show a consistent effect on population trends. Based on these findings the study quantitatively underpins and ranks key factors shaping farmland bird populations in Germany.},

The objective of this essay is to analyse the new framework proposed for evaluation in the future CAP and to promote a collective discussion on how to make evaluations more usable, useful and reliable for users and practitioners. The first part of the paper analyses the main elements of evaluation during the different rural development programming cycles. A second part is dedicated to an examination of the current programming period (2014--2020) and the implications of the introduction of the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) and the evaluation plan. In a third part, we critically discuss the proposals for the next programming period and we offer some concluding reflections and two main open questions. From the analyses carried out, many elements emerge to encourage discussion on the role that evaluation has played and can play and the critical points to face. The experiences in rural development policies have introduced important changes in theoretical and implementation terms. In particular, they helped to build evaluation capacity and enabled the involvement of the civil society. However, it is also clear that the European Commission (EC) designed path has often led to an increase in rigidity and orthodoxy towards common frameworks compliance.},

Method: The study was conducted as a multivocal literature review that follows a predefined procedure in which studies from the scientific and grey literature are analyzed. Results: A new selection process within the search strategy was defined to conduct this review. 190 papers were retrieved from the literature and 7 papers were selected as primary studies. Our multivocal literature review identified six different serious games for software process education, at the same time analyzed the main methods used to assess them as well as their main outcomes as learning resources. Conclusion: The results of this review reveal that serious games have potential as supporting tools for software process standards education, but that more research and experimental outcomes are needed in order to observe the full potential of serious games as learning resources.},

  abstract = {An experiment was conducted to study the potential of compost made from dealcoholised grapevine marc and grape stalk (GM) as growing medium component in plug seedlings production of lettuce, tomato, pepper and melon. Four media were prepared: GM, a commercial peatmoss-based plug medium (Pt), used as control, and two GM+Pt mixtures (1:1 and 1:2, v:v). Their physico-chemical characteristics were analysed, and bioassays were carried out for the detection of their phytotoxicity and nitrogen drawdown index (NDI). Seedlings grown in a greenhouse in Seville, during spring 2007, were irrigated 5 days a week with a Hoagland solution. Each species was arranged in a randomised block design with four replications. Substrates showed no phytotoxicity or nitrogen immobilisation. Physical characteristics of GM suggested some limitations for use as growing medium in plug seedlings production (total available water content of 12.7\% in GM and 25.9\% in Pt), although it can be avoided by blending with other substrates and by managing irrigation. At the time of transplant lettuce seedlings showed only differences in green colour intensity measured by SPAD, which was higher in GM (20.3) that in Pt (18.7). Seedling height of pepper, melon and tomato grown in GM was on average 30\% lower than that achieved in Pt. The height increased as the proportion of Pt in the substrates did so. There were also differences in dry weight and root neck diameter in tomato and melon that were lower in GM than in Pt. Both parameters improved with the proportion of Pt in the mixtures. Plants analyses showed significant differences that did vary depending on the species and the treatment, and they suggest nutrient imbalances in seedlings. These results would indicate that, under a correct irrigation and fertilisation management, GM and GM+Pt blending could be used successfully as medium component for plug production of vegetable seedlings.},

  abstract = {The advent of inexpensive consumer virtual reality display technology has made new possibilities for delivering education and training in immersive and engaging ways widely available. In the past, technical challenges and prohibitive cost have impeded progress of virtual reality in education. Educational institutions and industries are now moving rapidly to adopt virtual reality as a key training tool. Virtual learning environments have been very successful in generating positive learning outcomes in a variety of domains. The powerful sense of presence and effective immersion created by virtual reality applications promise to provide on-site training in a safe and controlled environment. Virtual learning environments can provide trainees with access to cost-prohibitive equipment in impossible locations. It can provide a space for students to explore problem spaces and test solutions without risk. Despite these successes, questions remain regarding the capabilities and limitations of current technology, particularly regarding the effectiveness of knowledge and skill acquisition in virtual reality. The process for developing effective educational training virtual environments begins with understanding the learning objectives, re-creation of the real-world task(s), and assessing user performance and learning. Each stage of the process presents unique challenges and opportunities.},

  abstract = {Serious games are digital games that have an additional goal beyond entertainment. Recently, many studies have explored different quality criteria for serious games, including effectiveness and attractiveness. Unfortunately, the double mission of serious games, that is, simultaneous achievement of intended effects (serious part) and entertainment (game part), is not adequately considered in these studies. This paper aims to identify essential quality criteria for serious games. The fundamental goal of our research is to identify important factors of serious games and to adapt the existing principles and requirements from game-related literature to effective and attractive serious games. In addition to the review of the relevant literature, we also include workshop results. Furthermore, we analyzed and summarized 22 state-of-the-art serious games for education and health. The selected best-practice serious games either prove their effectiveness through scientific studies or by winning game awards. For the analysis of these games, we refer to ``DIN SPEC 91380 Serious Games Metadata Format.'' A summarized text states quality criteria for both the serious and the game part, and especially the balance between them. We provide guidelines for high-quality serious games drawn from literature analysis and in close cooperation with domain experts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some algae are an excellent sources of vitamin B12, of special interest for vegetarian/vegan consumers, and of fucose to supplement fruit and vegetable beverages such as smoothies. Nevertheless, supplementation of smoothies with algae may lead to possible quality changes during smoothie shelf life that need to be studied. Therefore, the quality changes in fresh green smoothies supplemented (2.2\%) with nine edible algae (sea lettuce, kombu, wakame, thongweed, dulse, Irish moss, nori, Spirulina and Chlorella) were studied throughout 24 days at 5 {$^\circ$}C. RESULTS: The initial vitamin C content - 238.7-326.0 mg kg-1 fresh weight (FW) - of a 200 g portion of any of the smoothies ensured full coverage of its recommended daily intake, and still supplying 50-60\% of the recommended intake after 7 days. Chlorella and Spirulina smoothies showed the highest vitamin B12 content (33.3 and 15.3 {\textmu}g kg-1 FW, respectively), while brown algae showed fucose content of 141.1-571.3 mg kg-1 FW. These vitamin B12 and fucose contents were highly maintained during shelf life. CONCLUSION: The Spirulina supplementation of a 200 g smoothie portion ensured full coverage of the recommended vitamin B12 intake, with lower vitamin C degradation, during a shelf life of 17 days. Furthermore, thongweed and kombu are also considered as excellent fucose sources with similar shelf life. {\copyright} 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality has great potential for immersive experiences that is not available in other mediums. Thus, it has a significant place in the entertainment and the game industry. However, creating a well-designed immersive experience can be extremely complicated due to the replacement of human perception from the real-world to an isolated virtual world. Understanding the essentials of virtual reality (VR) experiences and game design principles is necessary for designing an immersive VR game. Although there are many differences in design elements of VR games according to the experience that is wanted to be given to the player, many games also have common elements. In the line of this view, a guideline is aimed to be framed for VR game designers in the current study. For this purpose design pillars of VR experiences and game design principles were reviewed, and five VR games were analyzed. Games are highly plastic mediums that can be adapted to any environment and technology. Many game types have a close relationship in terms of game elements and design. However, the implementation of game elements from other mediums to the VR medium is challenging. Therefore, game design principles should be well-comprehended and implemented to the VR medium by considering the existed technology.  Virtual reality takes the player and put him in a new virtual world. In this world, everything should be designed to be easily perceivable by the player. Thus, the human perception was reviewed as one of the design pillars. Virtual reality also offers an interactive experience that allows the user to affect the world. Like in traditional video games, players can interact and navigate in the virtual world. Therefore, interaction and navigation were reviewed as two other design pillars. Based on the reviewed design pillars, five VR games were analyzed. Then, a VR game design guideline is proposed based on common game design elements in those games},

We can live a meaningful life in virtual reality. We may even be living in a computer simulation already-and if we are, that's not so bad. What is reality, anyway? How do we know there's an external world? What's the relation between mind and body? How can we lead a good life? Is there a god? In Reality+, Chalmers conducts a grand tour of philosophy, using virtual worlds to illuminate all of these questions and to provide new answers to many of them. Studded with illustrations that bring philosophical issues to life, Reality+ is a major statement that will shape discussion of philosophy and technology for years to come"--},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous components of biocrust communities and the first colonizers of terrestrial ecosystems. They play multiple roles in the soil by fixing C and N and synthesizing exopolysaccharides, which increase soil fertility and water retention and improve soil structure and stability. Application of cyanobacteria as inoculants to promote biocrust development has been proposed as a novel biotechnological technique for restoring barren degraded areas and combating desertification processes in arid lands. However, previous to their widespread application under field conditions, research is needed to ensure the selection of the most suitable species. In this study, we inoculated two cyanobacterial species, Phormidium ambiguum (non N-fixing) and Scytonema javanicum (N-fixing), on different textured soils (from silt loam to sandy), and analyzed cyanobacteria biocrust development and evolution of physicochemical soil properties for 3 months under laboratory conditions. Cyanobacteria inoculation led to biocrust formation in all soil types. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed contrasting structure of the biocrust induced by the two cyanobacteria. The one from P. ambiguum was characterized by thin filaments that enveloped soil particles and created a dense, entangled network, while the one from S. javanicum consisted of thicker filaments that grouped as bunches in between soil particles. Biocrust development, assessed by chlorophyll a content and crust spectral properties, was higher in S. javanicum-inoculated soils compared to P. ambiguum-inoculated soils. Either cyanobacteria inoculation did not increase soil hydrophobicity. S. javanicum promoted a higher increase in total organic C and total N content, while P. ambiguum was more effective in increasing total exopolysaccharide (EPS) content and soil penetration resistance. The effects of cyanobacteria inoculation also differed among soil types and the highest improvement in soil fertility compared to non-inoculated soils was found in sandy and silty soils, which originally had lowest fertility. On the whole, the improvement in soil fertility and stability supports the viability of using cyanobacteria to restore degraded arid soils.},

Therefore, this study combined the spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) and a hands-on activity to help fifth-grade students learn natural geomorphological knowledge. The experimental group students used the hands-on approach to design a SVVR system to learn natural geomorphological knowledge; the control group used the conventional SVVR guiding system to learn. From the experimental results, there were non-significant differences in the learning achievement and learning motivation of students in the experimental and control groups. However, the students in the experimental group had better achievement on the in-depth knowledge test. In other words, the experimental group students needed to understand more about the learning content of natural geomorphological knowledge to design the VR system. Moreover, the hands-on approach cultivated their problem-solving and metacognitive skills.},

  abstract = {In the last year, educational experiences have become increasingly challenging due to teaching classes remotely. For this reason, it has been necessary to develop educational strategies that accompany the use of new technologies to maintain student interest. One of these methodologies is gamification, implemented in school environments more frequently due to the pandemic and whose impact on student motivation and engagement needs to be explored. The literature shows that student participation in these contexts should be increased when applying this methodology, where teachers can also provide greater support. This research proposes improving these aspects by developing a gamification strategy that can be easily replicated in other environments. This study was carried out for a chemistry course at a university in central Mexico. This proposal details the short-, medium-, and long-term bonuses which stimulated and motivated students and achieved specific objectives. We also present the quantitative results of a questionnaire applied to 48 engineering students to identify their perceptions of how gamification could increase motivation and engagement in learning the subject of chemistry. In addition, pre- and post-knowledge tests were applied to determine whether there were changes in the learning outcomes. The results indicated that gamification increased student motivation and engagement, improved attitudes, promoted actions such as keeping the camera on during lectures and regular attendance, and improved student grades. This study fills the need for planning strategies to help improve student motivation in online classes and proposes an instrument to measure the results. It can be helpful to those interested in applying or adapting it in other disciplines.},

The two techniques are contrasted through 3D modeling of a fifteenth-century Spanish town called Briviesca, in an immersive environment, viewed with Oculus Rift. The suitability of virtual reality for teaching is assessed through questions on historical knowledge and urban layout. The understanding of the undergraduate students is evaluated, through questionnaires, after the viewing sessions. The responses of the students underline the effectiveness of the two methodologies: Video screenings received higher scores for historical ideas and the virtual tour was the most effective method at conveying knowledge learnt while viewing. Additionally, two user movements for controlling the virtual reality environment were tested: (1) gamepad locomotion and (2) roomscale movements combined with teleporting. The clear advantage of the second option was the total lack of motion sickness effects. However, the natural tendency using teleporting was to move very quickly through the city areas with no singular buildings and to spend more time in front of these types of buildings. They therefore missed visual information related to the first areas while retaining more information related to those buildings. Finally, the spatial location of singular buildings was clearly better acquired with the virtual tour.},

In an attempt to better understand how virtual worlds positively affect student learning, this study used an online 3D VR English language learning platform and conducted an experiment to evaluate the student learning effectiveness based on Bloom's cognitive complexity level. t test analysis was used to determine the effectiveness of the learning platform, while structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used to determine the learning model behind the pedagogy. Participants were 448 students at a science and technology university in Taiwan. Results show that students improved their phonological, morphological, grammar and syntax knowledge, and virtual world learning assisted in the development of a more complex and higher level of thinking.

  abstract = {Pollution poses an increasing threat to the environment and to human health. Nitrogen pollution is of great concern, with nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the air and ammonia nitrogen in water being two major pollutants. Culturing microalgae in NOx or wastewater with high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen would both reduce environmental pollution and provide a source of nitrogen for microalgal culture. However, for microalgae-based bioremediation to be feasible, many fundamental questions about algal biology must be addressed. This review summarizes progress in microalgal biotransformation, outlines applications of this technology, and provides an in-depth description of the current state of microalgae-based bioremediation of NOx or wastewater with high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen. Furthermore, we present possible solutions to some of the obstacles that must be overcome to realize the practical applications of microalgae-based bioremediation.},

  abstract = {Environmental concerns are obstacles that all humans should confront. Accordingly, Taiwan has incorporated environmental education into its curriculum guidelines; however, difficulties have been encountered in its implementation because Taiwanese society clings to the concept of credentialism, students cannot focus in class, and course content is too abstract. Virtual reality (VR) techniques have been incorporated into the field of education for years; because they can increase the interestingness of learning and also concretely present matters through gamification, the present study applied VR techniques to resolve the aforementioned difficulties. VR can build environments and situations that would be impossible to visit in the real world, e.g., travel inside a human body, or the physically impossible---the surface of Mars. The aim was to increase students' immersion in class would generate empathy toward the natural environment and perform actual behaviors to protect it. In terms of the experimental design, gender and teaching methods were defined as independent variables, and observation and questionnaires were conducted and applied to examine students' immersion, empathy, and behaviors after learning. Participants in the experimental group watched a 3D video through a semi-immersive VR device, whereas those in the control group watched an ordinary video accompanied by an explanation from the teacher. The numbers of male and female students were equally allocated, and the learning outcomes of the two groups were further examined. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance test was conducted to examine the influences of 2(genders) {\texttimes} 2(teaching methods) on students' immersion, empathy, and actual behaviors and also mainly to inspect whether the differences between genders and teaching methods resulted in a direct influence or interaction. The experimental results revealed that the effectiveness of the application of VR techniques is affected by gender; female students presented more favorable performance in both empathy and actual behaviors. In brief, VR techniques can generally enhance students' learning outcomes; however, limitations such as the cost of VR devices and material designs should also be considered.},

Although it is commonly viewed as solely an entertainment platform, VR can greatly facilitate instruction by immersing the user in an interactive environment. This idea led to the development of SplashSim, a mobile-based VR application that guides the user through the stages of the water cycle from the perspective of a water droplet. Through this approach, SplashSim enables the user to experience the water cycle in a unique and engaging way. With immersive VR environments such as SplashSim, users can more closely scrutinize the water cycle and other important mechanisms that are not readily observed in the classroom setting.},

  abstract = {This study describes the parameterization of biomass functions applicable to oak (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) trees grown in the conditions of Central-European forestry. It is based on destructive measurements of 51 grown trees sampled from 6 sites in different regions of the Czech Republic important for oak forest management. The samples covered trees of breast height diameter (D) ranging from 6 to 59 cm, tree height (H) from 6 to 32 m and age between 12 and 152 years. The parameterization was performed for total aboveground biomass and its individual components. The two basic levels of biomass functions utilized D either as a single independent variable or in combination with H. The functions of the third level represented the best function for each biomass component with the optimal combination of available independent variables, which included D, H, crown length (CL), crown width (CW), crown ratio (CR = CL/H), tree age and site altitude. D was found to be a particularly strong predictor for total tree aboveground biomass. H was found to always improve the fit, particularly for the individual components of aboveground biomass. The contribution of CW was minor, but significant for all biomass components, whereas CL and CR were found useful for the components of stem and living branches, respectively. Finally, the remaining variables tree age and altitude were each justified only for one component function, namely living branch biomass and stem bark, respectively. The study also compares the fitted functions with other available references applicable to oak trees.},

The aim of this article is to use the first author's lived experience to explore the pertinence of maintaining the patient's centrality in care planning. It is also argued that patient-centered care is the rhetoric within contemporary funding models rather than the reality of practice.

  abstract = {When teachers gesture during instruction, children retain and generalize what they are taught (Goldin-Meadow, 2014). But why does gesture have such a powerful effect on learning? Previous research shows that children learn most from a math lesson when teachers present one problem-solving strategy in speech while simultaneously presenting a different, but complementary, strategy in gesture (Singer \& Goldin-Meadow, 2005). One possibility is that gesture is powerful in this context because it presents information simultaneously with speech. Alternatively, gesture may be effective simply because it involves the body, in which case the timing of information presented in speech and gesture may be less important for learning. Here we find evidence for the importance of simultaneity: 3rd grade children retain and generalize what they learn from a math lesson better when given instruction containing simultaneous speech and gesture than when given instruction containing sequential speech and gesture. Interpreting these results in the context of theories of multimodal learning, we find that gesture capitalizes on its synchrony with speech to promote learning that lasts and can be generalized.},

A group of 49 third and fourth grade children were given instruction in mathematical equivalence with gesture or without it. Children given instruction that included a correct problem-solving strategy in gesture were significantly more likely to produce that strategy in their own gestures during the same instruction period than children not exposed to the strategy in gesture. Those children were then significantly more likely to succeed on a posttest than children who did not produce the strategy in gesture. Gesture during instruction encourages children to produce gestures of their own, which, in turn, leads to learning. Children may be able to use their hands to change their minds.},

However, given the large number of game engines and frameworks dedicated to entertainment game development, deciding on which tool to employ may be difficult. A literature review that examined the frameworks and game engines used to develop serious games was recently conducted. Here, a list of the most commonly identified frameworks and game engines and a summary of their features is provided. The results presented provide insight to those seeking tools to develop serious games.},

  abstract = {Background. Much literature has theorized on the potential educational benefits offered by game-based learning (GBL). However, recent meta-data analyses of studies conducted on the efficacy of GBL offer mixed results. Furthermore, many of the studies available rely more on close reading, inference, small sample sizes, and qualitative responses than on quantitative, data-driven analyses.             Aim. This article describes a proof-of-concept study designed to assess the effects of GBL on enjoyment, engagement, and learning in higher education using a large sample size and quantitative measures.             Method. The study uses a large data set (n = 440) involving English, Math and Science undergraduate courses. For the first semester, faculty participants were trained in how to implement game-based pedagogy and created analog game-based lessons. In the following semester, each professor taught one section of a course using games and another section of the same course without games. Students in the game-based and control groups were given attitude surveys about the subject at the beginning of the semester, a post-lesson survey after the game or regular lesson, and a post-lesson quiz with separate questions to assess surface learning and deep learning.             Results. Enjoyment correlated with improvements in deep learning in both the game and non-game classes. Games increased reported enjoyment levels, especially in subjects where students reported the greatest anxiety about learning, and this increase in enjoyment correlated positively with improvements in deep learning and higher-order thinking. These results may have particular impact on non-traditional students.             Conclusion. While further investigation is necessary to assess the specific affordances and long-term effects of GBL in higher education, this study offers preliminary support for the claim that GBL can improve deep learning in this setting, by increasing enjoyment.},

  abstract = {The agri-food sector is under increased pressure from consumers to improve on the sustainability of production processes. Policies that incentivise farmers to improve environmental performance, such as agri-environment schemes (AES), are increasingly important. Understanding the choice to participate in these programmes aids policymakers in designing schemes that meet participation and environmental goals. While a number of studies have investigated the decision using cross-sectional data on one or multiple locations, very few have used longitudinal data to investigate the impact of institutional changes over time. Using Ireland as a case study, this paper uses a nationally representative panel of data spanning 23 years to model the impact of scheme and policy changes on the type of farms participating in AES. This paper argues that environmental issues surrounding intensive farms (such as the loss of nutrients and sediment to water and greenhouse gas emissions) are not being optimally addressed in scheme design and further development of such programmes is needed to reduce negative environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Mapping and predicting the potential risk of fishing activities to large marine protected areas (MPAs), where management capacity is low but fish biomass may be globally important, is vital to prioritizing enforcement and maximizing conservation benefits. Drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs) are a highly effective fishing method employed in purse seine fisheries that attract and accumulate biomass fish, making fish easier to catch. However, dFADs are associated with several negative impacts, including high bycatch rates and lost or abandoned dFADs becoming beached on sensitive coastal areas (e.g., coral reefs). Using Lagrangian particle modeling, we determined the potential transit of dFADs in a large MPA around the Chagos Archipelago in the central Indian Ocean. We then quantified the risk of dFADs beaching on the archipelago's reefs and atolls and determined the potential for dFADs to pass through the MPA, accumulate biomass while within, and export it into areas where it can be legally fished (i.e., transit). Over one-third (37.51\%) of dFADs posed a risk of either beaching or transiting the MPA for {$>$}14 days, 17.70\% posed a risk of beaching or transiting the MPA for {$>$}30 days, and 13.11\% posed a risk of beaching or transiting the MPA for {$>$}40 days. Modeled dFADs deployed on the east and west of the perimeter were more likely to beach and have long transiting times (i.e., posed the highest risk). The Great Chagos Bank, the largest atoll in the archipelago, was the most likely site to be affected by dFADs beaching. Overall, understanding the interactions between static MPAs and drifting fishing gears is vital to developing suitable management plans to support enforcement of MPA boundaries and the functioning and sustainability of their associated biomass.},

In contrast, the impact of enjoyment on usage intentions has not been examined. Two studies are reported concerning the relative effects of usefulness and enjoyment on intentions to use, and usage of, computers in the workplace. Usefulness had a strong effect on usage intentions in both Study 1, regarding word processing software ({$\beta$}=.68), and Study 2, regarding business graphics programs ({$\beta$}=.79). As hypothesized, enjoyment also had a significant effect on intentions in both studies, controlling for perceived usefulness ({$\beta$}=.16 and 0.15 for Studies 1 and 2, respectively). Study 1 found that intentions correlated 0.63 with system usage and that usefulness and enjoyment influenced usage behavior entirely indirectly through their effects on intentions. In both studies, a positive interaction between usefulness and enjoyment was observed. Together, usefulness and enjoyment explained 62\% (Study 1) and 75\% (Study 2) of the variance in usage intentions. Moreover, usefulness and enjoyment were found to mediate fully the effects on usage intentions of perceived output quality and perceived ease of use. As hypothesized, a measure of task importance moderated the effects of ease of use and output quality on usefulness but not on enjoyment. Several implications are drawn for how to design computer programs to be both more useful and more enjoyable in order to increase their acceptability among potential users.},

First, we discuss how game related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. The systematic mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games, gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that "Software Process", "Software Design" and "Profession Practice" are the most recurring knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education. We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods.},

The two types of internalization are               introjection               , which entails taking in a value or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and               integration               , through which the regulation is assimilated with one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally controlling regulation, whereas integration results in self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that three facilitating contextual factors---namely, providing a meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and conveying choice---promote internalization, as evidenced by the subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also supported our expectation that when the social context supports self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the context does not support self-determination, introjection tends to occur.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The 3D reconstruction of historic buildings and cities offers an opportunity to experience the history of relevant objects and their development over the centuries. Digital visualisations of such historic objects allow for a more natural view of history as well as showing information that is not possible in a real world setting. New presentation forms, such as the virtual reality (VR) system HTC Vive, can be used to disseminate information in another dimension and simplify the access by changing the user's viewpoint from a listener and viewer into being an integrated part of an interactive situation. In general, this approach is a combination of education and entertainment, also known as ``edutainment'' or ``gamification'', a term used in the education sector as describing where motivation to learn is encouraged through adding a competitive element. It is thus a step away from simple consumption of information towards experiencing information and a more literal interpretation of ``living history''. In this contribution, we present the development of a 3D reconstruction of the two towns Segeberg and Gieschenhagen (today: Bad Segeberg) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany in the Early Modern Age around 1600. The historic landscape and its conversion from a reconstructed virtual town model into an interactive VR application is also described. The reconstruction is based on a recent digital terrain model as well as survey data of surviving buildings, historic visual information based on historic drawings and written accounts from that era. All datasets are combined to a single walkable virtual world that spans approximately 3 km{$^2$}.},

The consumption of N2 O results from its reduction to dinitrogen gas (N2 ) as part of the denitrification process. However, there is on-going debate regarding an alternative pathway, namely reduction of N2 O to NH4 (+) , or assimilatory N2 O consumption. To date, this pathway is poorly investigated and lacks unambiguous evidence. Enrichment of denitrifying activated sludge using a mineral nitrogen-free medium rendered a mixed culture capable of anoxic and oxic N2 O consumption. Dilution plating, isolation and DNA fingerprinting identified a collection of Pseudomonas stutzeri strains as dominant N2 O consumers in both anaerobic and aerobic enrichments. A detailed isotope tracing experiment with a P. stutzeri isolate showed that consumption of N2 O via assimilatory reduction to NH4 (+) was absent. Conversely, respiratory N2 O reduction was directly coupled to N2 fixation.},

In the present study, the environmental impacts generated by the application of 1\,kg of nitrogen from the algal biomass (biofertilizer) were analyzed through life cycle analysis. Nitrogen was recovered from a meat processing industry effluent in a high-rate algal pond. Impacts related to the entire biofertilizer chain were mainly impacting on climate changes (115 kgCO2eq). Other categories (particle formation, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity) were not very representative. Biomass cultivation was the most critical step regarding energy and time consumption. On the other hand, the use of effluent as the culture medium for microalgae growth reduced impact categories, such as freshwater eutrophication. Results showed that microalgae cultivation and harvesting steps need to be technologically developed, especially when compared to a conventional fertilizer already established in the market. In order to make microalgae biofertilizer environmental advantageous, alternatives should be beforehand: i) the use of photovoltaic energy instead of hydropower energy; ii) the use of a nitrogen richer effluent; iii) and the consideration of an environmental compensation for the treatment of effluent can be accounted for, disregarding the biomass production stage.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application ofVR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user's sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom--up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.},

However, most of it tends to look at the effects of these gaps rather than their causes. We argue that the use of autoethnographic methods would help us in identifying the root causes of these gaps and can bring us closer to finding potential solutions. In this paper, we focus on issues associated with effort estimation for HCI activities in three projects in three typical engagement models for outsourced software development projects in a mainstream IT company in India, namely Fixed Price model, Mixed model, and Time \& Material model. We found that the HCI practitioner needs to negotiate her position with several members of the team, both within the vendor and client organisations. At times, a foot-in-the-door project turns out to be a footin-the-mouth project. At other times, it leads to inefficiencies and imbalance of work load. The autoethnographic approach led to reflexive thinking by the HCI practitioner, helping her to develop a deeper understanding of all aspects of a problem, and bringing her closer to potential solutions in some cases. The paper also brings to light several aspects of autoethnography as a method, which can influence effort estimation of HCI activities for future projects.},

This evidence suggests that the current aggregate view of the Millennial student may be less than accurate. Statistics show that Millennial students are considerably diverse in backgrounds, personalities, and learning styles. Data are presented regarding technological predilection, multitasking, reading, critical thinking, professional behaviors, and learning styles, which indicate that students in the Millennial Generation may not be as homogenous in fundamental learning strategies and attitudes as is regularly proposed. Although their common character traits have implications for instruction, no available evidence demonstrates that these traits impact their fundamental process of learning. Many curricular strategies have been implemented to address alleged changes in the manner by which Millennial students learn. None has clearly shown superior outcomes in academic accomplishments or developing expertise for graduating students and concerns persist related to the successful engagement of Millennial students in the process of learning. Four factors for consideration in general curricular design are proposed to address student engagement and optimal knowledge acquisition for 21st century learners.

  abstract = {Abstract                                Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) systems offer several learning affordances, that is, characteristics that can elicit learning behaviors promoting learning outcomes in educational contexts. In particular, the immersive and interactive properties of these systems represent a strong opportunity to support the effective learning experiences. The present review aims at mapping IVR systems' use in K-12 and higher educational contexts and investigating their effectiveness in facilitating learning in terms of knowledge attainment and retention and motivational outcomes. The synthesis of the reviewed studies (                 n                 ~=~18) show that IVR can support a number of activities and experiences that in turn improve learning and motivate students to fulfill educational goals by eliciting their interest and engagement with the learning materials. The main advantage of IVR seems related to the possibility for users to have first-hand experiences that would not be possible in the real world, simultaneously offering unique opportunities for experiential and situated learning, as well as promoting students' motivation and engagement. Despite the promising findings, the reviewed studies present several methodological flaws: non-randomized trials, small sample sizes, unbalanced samples and non-validated measures. This in turn makes it difficult to generalize from these results. Future research is needed to investigate the unique opportunities of IVR in education.

There is an increasing use of immersive virtual reality (IVR) in different fields, including education.                                                                       Experiences in IVR promote sense of presence, sense of embodiment, while supporting attentional and emotional engagement.                                                                                                       What this paper adds?

The results of our systematic review show that IVR is a promising technology that can positively influence the students' learning achievements and motivation to learn.

The profusion of complex and rapidly-changing dynamic information being conveyed in operational environments has elevated interest in possible military applications of 3D technologies. 3D can be a powerful mechanism for clearer information portrayal, facilitating rapid and accurate identification of key elements essential to mission performance and operator safety. However, implementation of 3D within legacy systems can be costly, making integration prohibitive. Therefore, identifying which tasks may benefit from 3D or 2.5D versus simple 2D visualizations is critical. Unfortunately, there is no "bible" of human factors guidelines for usability optimization of 2D, 2.5D, or 3D visualizations nor for determining which display best serves a particular application. Establishing such guidelines would provide an invaluable tool for designers and operators. Defining issues common to each will enhance design effectiveness. This paper presents the results of an extensive review of open source literature addressing 3D information displays, with particular emphasis on comparison of true 3D with 2D and 2.5D representations and their utility for military tasks. Seventy-five papers are summarized, highlighting militarily relevant applications of 3D visualizations and 2.5D perspective renderings. Based on these findings, human factors guidelines for when and how to use these visualizations, along with recommendations for further research are discussed.},

Like the multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) interface that underlies Internet games, AR is a good medium for immersive collaborative simulation, but has different strengths and limitations than MUVEs. Within a design-based research project, the researchers conducted multiple qualitative case studies across two middle schools (6th and 7th grade) and one high school (10th grade) in the northeastern United States to document the affordances and limitations of AR simulations from the student and teacher perspective. The researchers collected data through formal and informal interviews, direct observations, web site posts, and site documents. Teachers and students reported that the technology-mediated narrative and the interactive, situated, collaborative problem solving affordances of the AR simulation were highly engaging, especially among students who had previously presented behavioral and academic challenges for the teachers. However, while the AR simulation provided potentially transformative added value, it simultaneously presented unique technological, managerial, and cognitive challenges to teaching and learning.},

A review of the literature reveals the following three design principles as instructive: 1. Enable and then challenge (challenge): 2. Drive by gamified story (fantasy); and 3. See the unseen (curiosity). These design principles can also be viewed as an attempt to either leverage the unique affor- dances of AR or minimize the limitations of the medium as reported in the literature (Dunleavy \& Dede, 2014). As the field matures and more research teams explore the potential of AR to enhance teaching and learning, it will be critical to determine the design techniques that optimize the unique affordances of AR, minimize the limitations of the medium, and ultimately enhance learning across the curriculum.},

One organization categorizes as critically endangered any species whose populations decline by 80\% over 10 years, whereas others assign importance to species declining 50\% over 25 years. Using these and additional conservation-alert categories, I determined how many of over 200 bird species that breed in Canada qualified for each category, based on population trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The majority of qualifying species were not candidates for immediate intervention to halt or reverse declines. Moreover, species assigned to alert categories based on 5- and 10-year trends for past time periods frequently had positive trends in the subsequent decade. Results indicate that population decline should not be used to identify species at risk or as a basis for conservation action without detailed evaluation of the trend data and other characteristics of the species. However, assigning species to alert categories is a useful step in identifying species that may deserve conservation attention of some kind (including better monitoring and research as well as direct intervention). Evaluation of trend quality and persistence is an important step in determining the most appropriate action. Deciding when to recommend intervention will be the most problematic for species that are still relatively common and widespread, and there is a need for development of species-specific population thresholds that would be appropriate for triggering such action.},

Learning is one of the key processes to acquire information about the environment and adapt to changing and uncertain conditions. Learning has long been acknowledged in animals from invertebrates to vertebrates but remains a subject of debate in non-animal systems such a plants and single cell organisms. In this review I will attempt to answer the following question: are single cell organisms capable of learning? I will first briefly discuss the concept of learning and argue that the ability to acquire and store information through learning is pervasive and may be found in single cell organisms. Second, by focusing on habituation, the simplest form of learning, I will review a series of experiments showing that single cell organisms such as slime molds and ciliates display habituation and follow most of the criteria adopted by neuroscientists to define habituation. Then I will discuss disputed evidence suggesting that single cell organisms might also undergo more sophisticated forms of learning such as associative learning. Finally, I will stress out that the challenge for the future is less about whether or not to single cell organisms fulfill the definition of learning established from extensive studies in animal systems and more about acknowledging and understanding the range of behavioral plasticity exhibited by such fascinating organisms.},

Historical empathy is an important element of historical thinking, which is considered to improve conceptual understanding and support the development of democratic citizens by helping students interpret, understand and connect patterns of human activity across time. Fifty-three 3rd grade students, grouped in two research conditions, participated in this study. Students visited an archaeological site with and without the support of an AR learning environment on mobile tablet devices. Data from all students were collected following a pre- and post-test design. Twelve students from the AR condition participated in individual interviews and all AR students took a delayed post-test. The results showed that students' conceptual understanding and historical empathy increased from pre to post for both conditions. Statistically significant differences were found between the AR field trip and the traditional field trip students in the development of empathy and conceptual understanding. These results add to the literature by supporting the potential of AR technologies for the development of students' historical empathy; several design implications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction Training procedural skills in GI endoscopy once focused on threshold numbers. As threshold numbers poorly reflect individual competence, the focus gradually shifts towards a more individual approach. Tools to assess and document individual learning progress are being developed and incorporated in dedicated training curricula. However, there is a lack of consensus and training guidelines differ worldwide, which reflects uncertainties on optimal set-up of a training programme. Aims The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the currently available literature for the use of training and assessment methods in GI endoscopy. Second, we aimed to identify the role of simulator-based training as well as the value of continuous competence assessment in patient-based training. Third, we aimed to propose a structured training curriculum based on the presented evidence. Methods A literature search was carried out in the available medical and educational literature databases. The results were systematically reviewed and studies were included using a predefined protocol with independent assessment by two reviewers and a final consensus round. Results The literature search yielded 5846 studies. Ninety-four relevant studies on simulators, assessment methods, learning curves and training programmes for GI endoscopy met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven studies on simulator validation were included. Good validity was demonstrated for four simulators. Twenty-three studies reported on simulator training and learning curves, including 17 randomised control trials. Increased performance on a virtual reality (VR) simulator was shown in all studies. Improved performance in patient-based assessment was demonstrated in 14 studies. Four studies reported on the use of simulators for assessment of competence levels. Current simulators lack the discriminative power to determine competence levels in patient-based endoscopy. Eight out of 14 studies on colonoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endosonography reported on learning curves in patient-based endoscopy and proved the value of this approach for measuring performance. Ten studies explored the numbers needed to gain competence, but the proposed thresholds varied widely between them. Five out of nine studies describing the development and evaluation of assessment tools for GI endoscopy provided insight into the performance of endoscopists. Five out of seven studies proved that intense training programmes result in good performance. Conclusions The use of validated VR simulators in the early training setting accelerates the learning of practical skills. Learning curves are valuable for the continuous assessment of performance and are more relevant than threshold numbers. Future research will strengthen these conclusions by evaluating simulation-based as well as patient-based training in GI endoscopy. A complete curriculum with the assessment of competence throughout training needs to be developed for all GI endoscopy procedures.},

In particular, the review focuses on how previous research treats the inherent duality of video game development, since it both involves computer software development and creative production. Researchers are often in a position where they need to emphasize game development's relation to one of these disciplines, and it is not unusual for game development to be treated as a direct offspring of one field with some mild influences from another. Employing a more all-encompassing review approach, that includes research conducted from the perspectives of both computer science and the arts and humanities equally, makes the presented study different from previous literature reviews. The results show that there is a tendency that the management of software development has a negative correlation with the management of creativity in the studied material. The heterogenity of the fields and the limited amount of studies that focus on the duality of game development suggest that there is a need for a deeper analysis of the individual components and to synthesize results from disparate fields.},

History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects.Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history.Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game.Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom.Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.},

Such topics can deter students from selecting particular courses or hinder their study progress. This study focused on the subject of medicinal chemistry, which is a discipline combining medicine and chemistry. This combination of applied and basic science creates a complex field of education that is challenging to both teach and learn. Chemical and pharmacological principles are typically presented in 2D molecular structures and, recently, 3D molecular models have been utilized to improve the visualization of chemical compounds and their chemical interactions. Contemporary studies have presented Virtual Reality (VR) as an alternative method for improving the learning and teaching of multidisciplinary specialties such as this. However, current educational efforts employing VR offer limited interactivity and a traditional teaching method previously presented in 2D. This reduces students' interest and concentration in the taught subjects. This paper presents the development rationale of a novel VR educational application based on the evaluation of the user requirements by 405 pharmacy undergraduate students. The results informed the development and preliminary evaluation of a proposed VR serious game application, which was deployed in a real-life class environment and evaluated in contrast to traditional teaching methods by 15 students. The derived results confirmed the advantages of VR technology as a learning and teaching tool, in addition to the end-users' willingness to adopt VR systems as a learning aid.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the global radiative balance and atmospheric ozone chemistry, its sources and sinks within the Earth's system are still poorly understood. In the ocean, N2O is produced by microbiological processes such as nitrification and partial denitrification, which account for about a third of global emissions. Conversely, complete denitrification (the dissimilative reduction of N2O to N2) under suboxic/anoxic conditions is the only known pathway accountable for N2O consumption in the ocean. In this work, it is demonstrated that the biological assimilation of N2O could be a significant pathway capable of directly transforming this gas into particulate organic nitrogen (PON). N2O is shown to be biologically fixed within the subtropical and tropical waters of the eastern South Pacific Ocean, under a wide range of oceanographic conditions and at rates ranging from 2 pmol N L-1 d- to 14.8 nmol N L-1 d-1 (mean {\textpm} SE of 0.522{\textpm}1.06 nmol N L-1 d-1, n = 93). Additional assays revealed that cultured cyanobacterial strains of Trichodesmium (H-9 and IMS 101), and Crocosphaera (W-8501) have the capacity to directly fix N2O under laboratory conditions; suggesting that marine photoautotrophic diazotrophs could be using N2O as a substrate. This metabolic capacity however was absent in Synechococcus (RCC 1029). The findings presented here indicate that assimilative N2O fixation takes place under extreme environmental conditions (i.e., light, nutrient, oxygen) where both autotrophic (including cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic microbes appear to be involved. This process could provide a globally significant sink for atmospheric N2O which in turn affects the oceanic N2O inventory and may also represent a yet unexplored global oceanic source of fixed N.},

NO3-N was the proper N source, in comparison with other N source, including urea, NH4-N and NO2-N. As a result, aerobic nitrification of human urine was performed, with above 93.6\% nitrification percentage finally achieved with total-N (TN) load of 46.52 mg/(L{$\cdot$}d), in which Arthrospira platensis was successfully grown. The main compositions of the obtained biomass are close to those in Zarrouk medium. Thus, it is possible to culture Arthrospira platensis in nitrified human urine for food production within bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs).},

The final hydrogen potential (pH), \%C, \%N and C/N ratio, indicated an adequate development of the bioprocess. Satisfactory results were observed when the products were applied at several doses (1000--4000 kg/ha) as a soil conditioner for corn seed germination in greenhouses. Only the addition of hen droppings had a significant effect (P{$<$}0.05) on corn dry matter (14\% increase). A dose of 3000 kg/ha was considered as optimal and was used supplemented with triple superphosphate (TSP) in agronomic trials. All the treatments produced greater corn dry matter (P{$<$}0.05) than the chemical industrial fertilizer used as a control (0.52--0.71 g/pot for the organic fertilizers vs 0.45 g/pot for the control). Anaerobic conditions and hen droppings addition significantly produced (P{$<$}0.05) higher corn dry matter.},

  abstract = {Gamification is an innovative pedagogical approach to addressing problems related to social behaviour, student motivation and academic performance at different educational stages. Therefore, this research aimed to analyse its impact on the motivations and academic performances of university students. The research was carried out in the training of future teachers specialising in physical education during two academic courses. In total, 127 students participated in the study, divided into a gamified experimental group (n = 62) and a control group (n = 65). The participants completed a questionnaire to assess motivation in physical education before and after the intervention and performed a final exam to assess academic performance. The results indicated an increase in external regulation in the experimental group only. Furthermore, this group achieved significantly better academic performance. The findings of this study suggest that gamified implementation is beneficial for academic performance at the university stage, even though intrinsic motivation does not change. Furthermore, the nature of rewards or punishments, as characteristic of this pedagogical approach, could play an important role in the expected results, since external regulation increased significantly after the intervention.},

The development of the questionnaire with the authenticity dimensions instructor, location, method and innovation was based on theoretical models of the perception of authenticity in science education. In a validation study with N = 337 students in the out-of-school-lab at the Ruhr-University Bochum, the factor structure was confirmed by means of confirmatory factor analyses. The internal consistencies of all dimensions were satisfactory (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} {$\geq$} 0.81). Moreover, results proof measurement invariance for gender and class level. The correlations of the authenticity dimensions with external criteria such as epistemological beliefs provide further evidence for the validity of the subscales. Overall, the FEWAW is a suitable instrument for the multidimensional assessment of perceptions of authenticity in science education.},

  abstract = {Parentage analysis is a cornerstone of molecular ecology that has delivered fundamental insights into behaviour, ecology and evolution. Microsatellite markers have long been the king of parentage, their hypervariable nature conferring sufficient power to correctly assign offspring to parents. However, microsatellite markers have seen a sharp decline in use with the rise of next-generation sequencing technologies, especially in the study of population genetics and local adaptation. The time is ripe to review the current state of parentage analysis and see how it stands to be affected by the emergence of next-generation sequencing approaches. We find that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the typical next-generation sequencing marker, remain underutilized in parentage analysis but are gaining momentum, with 58 SNP-based parentage analyses published thus far. Many of these papers, particularly the earlier ones, compare the power of SNPs and microsatellites in a parentage context. In virtually every case, SNPs are at least as powerful as microsatellite markers. As few as 100--500 SNPs are sufficient to resolve parentage completely in most situations. We also provide an overview of the analytical programs that are commonly used and compatible with SNP data. As the next-generation parentage enterprise grows, a reliance on likelihood and Bayesian approaches, as opposed to strict exclusion, will become increasingly important. We discuss some of the caveats surrounding the use of next-generation sequencing data for parentage analysis and conclude that the future is bright for this important realm of molecular ecology.},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.},

The VR system used is based on Unreal Engine programming of the HTC Vive sensor. This study is related to the GAME4City 3.0 and a broader project focused on gamified visualization and its educational uses in architectural and urban projects. The results reflect great interest, good usability, and high motivation for further usage for all types of users. However, an apparent resistance to deepen its use continues to be perceived in academia. Based on the research results, weak points of educational gamified systems have been identified, and the main differences and needs in user profiles' function. With these data, progress regarding implementing this kind of system at the teaching and professional levels must be pursued.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper was to build upon Dalgarno and Lee's model or framework of learning in three-dimensional (3-D) virtual learning environments (VLEs) and to extend their road map for further research in this area. The enhanced model shares the common goal with Dalgarno and Lee of identifying the learning benefits from using 3-D VLEs. The approach adopted here is to attempt a more pedagogical description using the concept of pedagogical immersion as derived from Mayes and Fowler's framework for mapping stages of learning onto types of learning environment. The paper adopts a ``design for learning'' perspective and in doing so hopes the combined framework will prove useful to those designing learning activities in 3-D VLEs.},

  abstract = {The current loss of biodiversity has been broadly acknowledged as the main cause of ecosystem change. To halt this trend, several international agreements have been made, and various biodiversity metrics have been developed to evaluate whether the targets of these agreements are being met. The process of developing good indicators is not trivial. Indicators should be able to synthesize and communicate our current knowledge, but they also need to meet both scientific and practical criteria. Since it would not be practical to monitor all species, indicators are mainly built on the monitoring of some well-known taxa, such as birds. Here we systematically review the wide spectrum of bird biodiversity indicators (hereafter indicators) available to: i) evaluate recent methodological advances; ii) identify current knowledge gaps jeopardizing indicator interpretation and use in guiding decision-making; and iii) examine challenges in their applicability across different spatial and temporal contexts. We pay particular attention to indicator characteristics such as site and species selection, spatial, seasonal and habitat coverage, and statistical issues in developing indicators and tools to tackle them, to provide specific recommendations for the future construction of indicators. Several methodological advances have recently been made to enhance the process of indicator development, including multiple ways to select sites and species to increase their robustness. However, we found that there are strong spatial, seasonal and habitat biases among the selected indicators. Most of them are from Europe, using mainly census data from the breeding season and typically covering farmland and forest habitats. The major challenges that we detected in their applicability were related to the modelling of the statistical uncertainty associated to the indicator. We recommend the use of quantitative methods in site and species selection procedures whenever possible. Current indicators should be expanded to areas outside Europe and to less studied habitats and should not neglect monitoring work outside the breeding season. Time-series analyses studying temporal trends and using multi-species data should in general account for temporal autocorrelation as well as for phylogenetic correlation. Multi-species hierarchical models are a good alternative for analysing and constructing indicators, but they need to include annual random effects allowing for unexplained annual variation in the average status of the community, i.e. the indicator target. Despite methodological and context-specific differences in the indicators reviewed, most of them seem to highlight the urgent need of devising strategic climate and conservation policies to improve the status and trends of biodiversity.},

This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of introducing new SSGs to a non-computer related educational environment---biomedical laboratory science (BLS) education. By following the choice, construction, and evaluation of a gamified app for practicing phlebotomy (StikkApp), not only the usefulness of the application, but also the general needs and possibilities for supporting SSG applications, are discussed. This paper presents the evaluation of StikkApp through an experimental study examining its use on mobile devices, as a web app and by discussing challenges for a corresponding virtual reality app by BLS students and their teachers. This evaluation focused on questions concerning usage scenarios, technologies, and how the design of the app can be aligned to learning goals necessary for education. By discussing these requirements and possibilities for apps and technology support for using SSG apps for BLS students, this paper contributes to a better understanding of using digital support for sustainable education.},

  abstract = {This paper debates the necessity of implementing Virtual Reality Technology as a training tool within Lean Manufacturing Environments (LME). The topic for discussion surrounding this area is the need for a user friendly package that utilizes game and advanced Virtual Reality (VR) Technology to encompass the principles of the Lean approach to manufacturing. Fundamental principles adopted by video game developers attempting to immerse the user could provide a key, through allowing for a fully immersive manufacturing simulation software package. The implementation of VR and training software that would not only teach, but also showcase new technology and show its relevance in a manufacturing system. As a result the use of Lean philosophy acts as a conduit in the implementation of the VR software in adaptable modern manufacturing. Literature within Lean Manufacturing and Video Game Development Immersion Methodologies allow for a juxtaposition between the two, through promoting the validity of novel simulation training techniques. Evaluating case studies of Lean Manufacturing applications will ascertain the need for innovative adaptations, by determining whether solutions could be further improved by latest technological advancements. This paper critically appraises gaming technology and its evolution towards sophisticated design solutions. Learning theories adopted through gaming reveal new approaches to motivational drivers in developing necessary skill sets for modern workforces. Studies surrounding objective based instructional learning highlight rarely acknowledged fields in manufacturing simulation testing. Project Sponsor: Nottingham Trent University \& PepsiCo The simulation software is to be built using Unity3D with scripting in C\# and Java Script which emulates running of a manufacturing cell within a Lean environment. Its purpose is to train and educate personnel through simulating a functioning manufacturing cell. The software displays potential Lean wastes and problems such as bottle necking. It is imperative to the development of modern manufacturing environments that new simulation techniques in educating workforces, creating prototypes and testing are embraced. Currently only the latter two developments are predominantly created in unison. In Lean, this is wasteful in terms of transport and skill if these are not performed in-house. The need for a more user friendly and intuitive simulation experience requires clarity for potential manufacturers in order to adopt this methodology. Not enough varied Lean manufacturing companies embody Lean principles on a computational software level and as a result could potentially leave entire generations without modern manufacturing skill sets. The concept of VR used in modern Manufacturing Simulation Software (MSS) can be utilised to dispel any belief that VR is solely an entertainment medium. Through examination of Lean Principles and Video Game Development immersion strategies this research highlights the little recognized area of an Immersive Manufacturing Training and Design Testing Application. It is clear that Modern manufacturing environments need to become aware of Lean philosophies of adaptability. There is a requirement to inform companies about utilisation of the latest technologies in order to educate workforces in an efficient and Lean manner. The software runs a simulation on a Zspace 3D display screen in a 3D VR format.},

Phycobiliproteins are light-harvesting and water-soluble proteins extracted from cyanobacteria and red algae that can be employed as natural additives. In the present work, a C-phycocyanin extract from the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis was tested as blue colorant in beverages to demonstrate that samples containing the protein extract have a color similar to marketed beverages containing synthetic dyes. Using spectroscopy and colorimetry, the extract was characterized and gave evidence of having good properties and good stability in the pH range between 3.0 and 9.0. The staining factors, representing the amount of blue protein needed to reproduce the color of bluish commercial samples, ranged between 15.6 and 111.7~mg{$\cdot$}L-1, being sufficiently low in all samples. Additionally, color stability during a short period of cold storage was studied: it demonstrated that isotonic and tonic beverages remained stable throughout the 11-days analysis period with no significant changes. These results prove that the C-phycocyanin extract has potential applications in food as natural colorant, being an alternative option to synthetic coloring molecules.},

Increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and the resulting decline in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are a major concern in agroecosystems. This nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere is influenced by an intimate soil microbiome--root exudate interaction and biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). A PANOMICS approach can dissect these processes. We review breakthroughs in this area, including identification and characterization of root exudates by metabolomics and proteomics, which facilitate better understanding of belowground chemical communications and help identify new biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs). We also address challenges for advancing the understanding of the role root exudates play in biotic and abiotic stresses.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the question how realistic Virtual Worlds should be designed in order to create engaging experiences and stimulate `natural' behaviour. Creating high realistic worlds is time consuming and expensive and it is unclear whether it is always needed. With the aim of gaining insights about questions related to presence and realism, an experiment involving 72 participants was set up upon a Virtual Reality cycling apparatus in which different levels of realism were created. Users were observed and evaluated regarding their experience (engagement, presence, naturalness and negative effects), awareness of realism and behaviour. The results indicate that, despite that differences in realism were observed, differences in realism do not have an effect on experience and behaviour. There seem other variables involved that can affect the whole experience in an enough intensity to obliterate the effects of a better sense of presence and realism. In addition, an increase in a perceived higher level of realism seems to be depended on a congruent increase of different elements within the virtual world. Merely increasing the level of realism of one element does not alter levels of perceived realism of users.},

As such, the framework holds the promise of providing a unifying perspective for psychological research. This article begins with a sketch of several arguments, from evolution to philosophy, as to why the embodiment framework is a good bet. These arguments are followed by a review of approaches to embodiment, including those from cognitive linguistics, perceptual symbol theory, and action-based theories. Finally, examples are provided for how a unifying perspective might work for cognition (including language and memory), cognitive and social development, social psychology, neuroscience, clinical psychology, and psychology applied to education.

Participants judged whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving toward or away from their bodies. When a sentence implied action in one direction (e.g., ``Close the drawer'' implies action away from the body), the participants had difficulty making a sensibility judgment requiring a response in the opposite direction. The ACE was demonstrated for three sentences types: imperative sentences, sentences describing the transfer of concrete objects, and sentences describing the transfer of abstract entities, such as ``Liz told you the story.'' These data are inconsistent with theories of language comprehension in which meaning is represented as a set of relations among nodes. Instead, the data support an embodied theory of meaning that relates the meaning of sentences to human action.},

But, much like institutionalized political parties, some of the ideas were becoming stale. Where was action? Where was the self? How could cognition be smoothly integrated with emotions, with social psychology, with development, with clinical analyses? Around that time, thinkers in linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, biology, and psychology were formulating the idea that just as overt behavior depends on the specifics of the body in action, so might cognition depend on the body. Here we characterize (some would say caricature) the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive psychology of that era, and then we describe what has come to be called embodied cognition: how cognition arises through the dynamic interplay of brain controlling bodily action controlling perception, which changes the brain. We focus on the importance of action and how action shapes perception, the self, and language. Having the body in action as a central consideration for theories of cognition promises, we believe, to help unify psychology.},

Both groups remembered significantly more items when they gestured during their math explanations than when they did not gesture. Gesturing appeared to save the speakers' cognitive resources on the explanation task, permitting the speakers to allocate more resources to the memory task. It is widely accepted that gesturing reflects a speaker's cognitive state, but our observations suggest that, by reducing cognitive load, gesturing may also play a role in shaping that state.},

Even more striking, gesture can mark a speaker as being in transition with respect to a task---learners who are on the verge of making progress on a task routinely produce gestures that convey information that is different from the information conveyed in speech. Gesture can thus be used to predict who will learn. In addition, evidence is mounting that gesture not only presages learning but also can play a role in bringing that learning about.

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to widen the lens on language to include the manual modality. We look first at hearing children who are acquiring language from a spoken language model and find that even before they use speech to communicate, they use gesture. Moreover, those gestures precede, and predict, the acquisition of structures in speech. We look next at deaf children whose hearing losses prevent them from using the oral modality, and whose hearing parents have not presented them with a language model in the manual modality. These children fall back on the manual modality to communicate and use gestures, which take on many of the forms and functions of natural language. These homemade gesture systems constitute the first step in the emergence of manual sign systems that are shared within deaf communities and are full-fledged languages. We end by widening the lens on sign language to include gesture and find that signers not only gesture, but they also use gesture in learning contexts just as speakers do. These findings suggest that what is key in gesture's ability to predict learning is its ability to add a second representational format to communication, rather than a second modality. Gesture can thus be language, assuming linguistic forms and functions, when other vehicles are not available; but when speech or sign is possible, gesture works along with language, providing an additional representational format that can promote learning.},

Yet empirical support for early stages of embodied word learning is currently lacking. Finding evidence that sensorimotor interaction shapes learned linguistic representations would provide crucial support for embodied language theories. We developed a gamified word learning experiment in virtual reality in which participants learned the names of six novel objects by grasping and manipulating objects with either their left or right hand. Participants then completed a word--color match task in which they were tested on the same six words and objects. Participants were faster to respond to stimuli in the match task when the response hand was compatible with the hand used to interact with the named object, an effect we refer to as affordance compatibility. In two follow up experiments, we found that merely observing virtual hands interact with the objects was sufficient to acquire a smaller affordance compatibility effect, and we found that the compatibility effect was driven primarily by responses with a compatible hand and not by responses in a compatible spatial location. Our results support theoretical views of language which ground word representations in sensorimotor experiences, and they suggest promising future routes to explore the sensorimotor foundations of higher cognition through immersive virtual experiments.},

This study aims to provide an update of the main identification methods of waste electrical and electronic equipment such as spectroscopic fingerprinting, thermal study, and sample techniques (like identification code and burning test), and the characteristic values in the case of the different analyses of the polymers commonly used in electrical and electronic equipment. Additionally, the quality of the identification is very important, as, depending on this, new materials with suitable properties can be obtained to be used in different industrial applications. The latest research in the field demonstrated that a complete characterization of individual WEEE (Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment) components is important to obtain information on the chemical and physical properties compared to the original polymers and their compounds. The future directions are heading towards reducing the costs by recycling single polymer plastic waste fractions that can replace virgin plastic at a ratio of almost 1:1.},

  abstract = {Entrepreneurship education constitutes a top priority in policy agendas across the globe as a means to promote economic growth, fight unemployment and create social capital. An important premise of entrepreneurship education is that it can be learned and students can be taught to formulate entrepreneurial mentality, skills and competencies, something that can result in the formulation of startups and business initiatives. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, the necessity to formulate efficient entrepreneurship education frameworks and training programs arise. In this work, we present the design of an entrepreneurship educational environment that is based on learning in 3D virtual worlds. Innovative 3D virtual reality technologies were utilized to provide immersive and efficient learning activities. Various topics of entrepreneurship education courses were designed and formulated to offer students the opportunity to obtain theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship. The 3D virtual reality educational environment utilizes pedagogical approaches that are based on gamification principles, allowing students to study in immersive ways as well as in game-based learning activities on real challenges that can be found in business environments. The game-based learning activities can help students gain necessary skills, helping them to tackle everyday obstacles on their entrepreneurial pathways. An experimental study was performed to explore the learning efficiency of the environment and the gamified learning activities as well as assess their learning impact on student's motivation, attitude, and overall learning experience. The evaluation study revealed that the framework offers efficient gamified learning activities that increase students' motivation and assist in the formulation of entrepreneurship mentality, skills and competencies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the last decades, production of microalgae and cyanobacteria has been developed for several applications, including novel foods, cosmetic ingredients and more recently biofuel. The sustainability of these promising developments can be hindered by some constraints, such as water and nutrient footprints. This review surveys data on N2-fixing cyanobacteria for biomass production and ways to induce and improve the excretion of ammonium within cultures under aerobic conditions. The nitrogenase complex is oxygen sensitive. Nevertheless, nitrogen fixation occurs under oxic conditions due to cyanobacteria-specific characteristics. For instance, in some cyanobacteria, the vegetative cell differentiation in heterocyts provides a well-adapted anaerobic microenvironment for nitrogenase protection. Therefore, cell cultures of oxygenic cyanobacteria have been grown in laboratory and pilot photobioreactors (Dasgupta et al., 2010; Fontes et al., 1987; Moreno et al., 2003; Nayak \& Das, 2013). Biomass production under diazotrophic conditions has been shown to be controlled by environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, aeration rate, and inorganic carbon concentration, also, more specifically, by the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the culture medium. Currently, there is little information regarding the production of extracellular ammonium by heterocytous cyanobacteria. This review compares the available data on maximum ammonium concentrations and analyses the specific rate production in cultures grown as free or immobilized filamentous cyanobacteria. Extracellular production of ammonium could be coupled, as suggested by recent research on non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria, to that of other high value metabolites. There is little information available regarding the possibility for using diazotrophic cyanobacteria as cellular factories may be in regard of the constraints due to nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract = {Using antibiotic assays and genomic analysis, this study demonstrates nitrous oxide (N2O) is generated from axenic Chlorella vulgaris cultures. In batch assays, this production is magnified under conditions favouring intracellular nitrite accumulation, but repressed when nitrate reductase (NR) activity is inhibited. These observations suggest N2O formation in C. vulgaris might proceed via NR-mediated nitrite reduction into nitric oxide (NO) acting as N2O precursor via a pathway similar to N2O formation in bacterial denitrifiers, although NO reduction to N2O under oxia remains unproven in plant cells. Alternatively, NR may reduce nitrite to nitroxyl (HNO), the latter being known to dimerize to N2O under oxia. Regardless of the precursor considered, an NRmediated nitrite reduction pathway provides a unifying explanation for correlations reported between N2O emissions from algae-based ecosystems and NR activity, nitrate concentration, nitrite concentration, and photosynthesis repression. Moreover, these results indicate microalgae-mediated N2O formation might significantly contribute to N2O emissions in algae-based ecosystems (e.g. 1.38--10.1 kg N2ON ha-1 yr-1 in a 0.25 m deep raceway pond operated under Mediterranean climatic conditions). These findings have profound implications for the life cycle analysis of algae biotechnologies and our understanding of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.},

First, a dataset comprising 1173 relevant publications was compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection databases (including the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Science Citation Index). Then, the publication distributions by time, author, institution, country/ region, and knowledge sources were analyzed to reveal the multidisciplinary integration paths. Dataset co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were conducted to identify the most popular research issues, the research chronology, and the emerging trends. It was found that: (a) ITS research has been growing in recent years. According to the Price literature exponential growth curve, this field is still in its initial stage while has high potential; (b) computer science, education, psychology, and engineering were the main ITS research knowledge sources, with ITS social science publications since 2007 being higher than ITS natural sciences publications; (c) interactive learning environments, student modeling, teaching/learning strategies, and machine learning have been the most popular research foci; and (d) the Coh-Metrix, problem-centered instruction, and STEM are the current research trends.},

The user only needs to provide a primitive initial controller and high-level, human-readable instructions as if s/he is coaching a human trainee, while the character has the ability to interpret the abstract instructions, accumulate the knowledge from the coach, and improve its skill iteratively. We introduce ``control rigs'' as an intermediate layer of control module to facilitate the mapping between high-level instructions and low-level control variables. Control rigs also utilize the human coach's knowledge to reduce the search space for control optimization. In addition, we develop a new sampling-based optimization method, Covariance Matrix Adaptation with Classification (CMA-C), to efficiently compute-control rig parameters. Based on the observation of human ability to ``learn from failure'', CMA-C utilizes the failed simulation trials to approximate an infeasible region in the space of control rig parameters, resulting a faster convergence for the CMA optimization. We demonstrate the design process of complex dynamic controllers using our framework, including precision jumps, turnaround jumps, monkey vaults, drop-and-rolls, and wall-backflips.},

The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students' project grades improved, particularly the implementation component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to traditional approach.},

Stabilized EENFs contain nitrification and/or urease inhibitors. Slow-release EENFs contain N components that are slowly released with variable release rates. Controlled-release EENFs release N at more predictable rates. The effectiveness of several EENFs in reducing soil N2O emissions from a clay loam soil under irrigated, corn (Zea mays L.)-based production systems in Colorado (2002--2012) was investigated. A controlled-release, polymer-coated urea, ESN, reduced N2O emissions by 42\% compared with urea and 14\% compared with urea--NH4NO3 solution (UAN) in no-till and strip-till environments, but had no effect in a conventional tillage environment. A stabilized urea source, SuperU, reduced N2O emissions by 46\% compared with urea and 21\% compared with UAN. A stabilized UAN source, UAN + AgrotainPlus, reduced N2O emissions by 61\% compared with urea and 41\% compared with UAN alone. A slow-release UAN source, UAN + Nfusion, reduced N2O emissions by 57\% compared with urea and 28\% compared with UAN. Urea--NH4NO3 reduced N2O emissions by 35\% compared with urea. A linear increase in N2O emissions with increasing N rate was observed for untreated urea and UAN. Developers of management protocols to reduce N2O emissions from irrigated cropping systems in semiarid areas can use this information to estimate reductions in N2O emissions when EENFs are used. Policymakers can use this information to help determine financial credits needed to encourage producers to use these technologies in their crop production systems.},

High fidelity graphics and immersive content using head-mounted-displays (HMD) have allowed students to explore complex subjects in a way that traditional teaching methods cannot. Despite this, research focusing on learning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with I-VR use has been sparse. To explore this, the current systematic review examined experimental studies published since 2013, where quantitative learning outcomes using HMD based I-VR were compared with less immersive pedagogical methods such as desktop computers and slideshows. A literature search yielded 29 publications that were deemed suitable for inclusion. Included papers were quality assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Most studies found a significant advantage of utilising I-VR in education, whilst a smaller number found no significant differences in attainment level regardless of whether I-VR or non-immersive methods were utilised. Only two studies found clear detrimental effects of using I-VR. However, most studies used short interventions, did not examine information retention, and were focused mainly on the teaching of scientific topics such as biology or physics. In addition, the MERSQI showed that the methods used to evaluate learning outcomes are often inadequate and this may affect the interpretation of I-VR's utility. The review highlights that a rigorous methodological approach through the identification of appropriate assessment measures, intervention characteristics, and learning outcomes is essential to understanding the potential of I-VR as a pedagogical method.},

A mixed-method approach was used to obtain an overall understanding of students' experiences with this immersive technology in an elementary classroom. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 27 elementary-school students through presence surveys and reflection papers. Statistical analyses were performed to compare immersive VFTs with traditional VFTs regarding students' virtual presence. Further, an inductive content analysis was performed to analyze reflection papers. The results showed an overall enhancement in virtual presence with the use of immersive VFTs. However, students felt that learning was not favorable with HMDs. The result of this study provides practical implications for the use of immersive VFTs in classroom settings.},

We developed an innovative medical-training simulator on the Oculus™ Gear-VR platform. This novel application was developed utilising internationally recognised Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, requiring decision-making skills for critically-injured virtual-patients. Methods Participants were recruited in June, 2016~at a single-centre trauma-course (ATLS, Leinster, Ireland) and trialled the platform. Simulator performances were correlated with individual expertise and course-performance measures. A post-intervention questionnaire relating to validity-aspects was completed. Results Eighteen(81.8\%) eligible-candidates and eleven(84.6\%) course-instructors voluntarily participated. The survey-responders mean-age was 38.9({\textpm}11.0) years with 80.8\% male predominance. The instructor-group caused significantly less fatal-errors (p~{$<~$}0.050) and proportions of incorrect-decisions (p~{$<~$}0.050). The VR-hardware and trauma-application's mean ratings were 5.09 and 5.04 out of 7 respectively. Participants reported it was an enjoyable method of learning (median-6.0), the learning platform of choice (median-5.0) and a cost-effective training tool (median-5.0). Conclusion Our research has demonstrated evidence of validity-criteria for a concept application on virtual-reality headsets. We believe that virtual-reality technology is a viable platform for medical-simulation into the future.},

B, 2009, 364 (1535), 3549--3557), we propose a general psychological parallel processing account to explain users' VR and XR experience. The model adopts a broad psychological view by building on interdisciplinary literature on the dualistic nature of perceiving and experiencing (mediated) representations. It proposes that perceptual sensations like presence are paralleled by users' belief that ``this is not really happening,'' which we refer to as media awareness. We review the developmental underpinnings of basic media awareness, and argue that it is triggered in users' conscious exposure to VR/XR. During exposure, the salience of media awareness can vary dynamically due to factors like encountered sensory and semantic (in)consistencies. Our account sketches media awareness and presence as two parallel processes that together define a situation as a media exposure situation. We also review potential joint effects on subsequent psychological and behavioral responses that characterize the user experience in VR/XR. We conclude the article with a programmatic outlook on testable assumptions and open questions for future research.},

The SPES is derived from a process model of spatial presence (Wirth et al., 2007, Media Psychology, 9, 493--525), and assesses spatial presence as a two-dimensional construct that comprises a user's self-location and perceived possible actions in a media environment. The SPES is shorter than many other available spatial presence scales, and can be conveniently applied to diverse media settings. Two studies are reported (N1 = 290, N2 = 395) that confirm sound psychometric qualities for the SPES.},

  abstract = {Due to the costly energy demands of nitrogen (N) fixation, diazotrophic bacteria have evolved complex regulatory networks that permit expression of the catalyst nitrogenase only under conditions of N starvation, whereas the same condition stimulates upregulation of high-affinity ammonia (NH3) assimilation by glutamine synthetase (GS), preventing excess release of excess NH3 for plants. Diazotrophic bacteria can be engineered to excrete NH3 by interference with GS, however control is required to minimise growth penalties and prevent unintended provision of NH3 to non-target plants. Here, we tested two strategies to control GS regulation and NH3 excretion in our model cereal symbiont Azorhizobium caulinodans AcLP, a derivative of ORS571. We first attempted to recapitulate previous work where mutation of both PII homologues glnB and glnK stimulated GS shutdown but found that one of these genes was essential for growth. Secondly, we expressed unidirectional adenylyl transferases (uATs) in a {$\Delta$}glnE mutant of AcLP which permitted strong GS shutdown and excretion of NH3 derived from N2 fixation and completely alleviated negative feedback regulation on nitrogenase expression. We placed a uAT allele under control of the NifA-dependent promoter PnifH, permitting GS shutdown and NH3 excretion specifically under microaerobic conditions, the same cue that initiates N2 fixation, then deleted nifA and transferred a rhizopine nifAL94Q/D95Q-rpoN controller plasmid into this strain, permitting coupled rhizopine-dependent activation of N2 fixation and NH3 excretion. This highly sophisticated and multi-layered control circuitry brings us a step closer to the development of a "synthetic symbioses'' where N2 fixation and NH3 excretion could be specifically activated in diazotrophic bacteria colonising transgenic rhizopine producing cereals, targeting delivery of fixed N to the crop while preventing interaction with non-target plants.},

  abstract = {People generally show greater preference for members of their own racial group compared to racial out-group members. This type of `in-group bias' is evident in mimicry behaviors. We tend to automatically mimic the behaviors of in-group members, and this behavior is associated with interpersonal sensitivity and empathy. However, mimicry is reduced when interacting with out-group members. Although race is considered an unchangeable trait, it is possible using embodiment in immersive virtual reality to engender the illusion in people of having a body of a different race. Previous research has used this technique to show that after a short period of embodiment of White people in a Black virtual body their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we show that this technique powerfully enhances mimicry. We carried out an experiment with 32 White (Caucasian) female participants. Half were embodied in a White virtual body and the remainder in a Black virtual body. Each interacted in two different sessions with a White and a Black virtual character, in counterbalanced order. The results show that dyads with the same virtual body skin color expressed greater mimicry than those of different color. Importantly, this effect occurred depending on the virtual body's race, not participants' actual racial group. When embodied in a Black virtual body, White participants treat Black as their novel in-group and Whites become their novel out-group. This reversed in-group bias effect was obtained regardless of participants' level of implicit racial bias. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this surprising psychological phenomenon.},

These results demonstrate that the referential meaning of action words has a correlate in the somatotopic activation of motor and premotor cortex. This rules out a unified "meaning center" in the human brain and supports a dynamic view according to which words are processed by distributed neuronal assemblies with cortical topographies that reflect word semantics.},

Three questions guided our review: (1) How are virtual worlds (eg,               Active Worlds               ,               Second Life               ) used by students and teachers? (2) What types of research methods have been applied? (3) What research topics have been conducted on virtual worlds in teaching and learning, as well as their related findings? Overall, we found that virtual worlds may be utilised for the following uses: (1) communication spaces, (2) simulation of space (spatial), and (3) experiential spaces (`acting' on the world). Most of the studies reviewed were descriptive and conducted in polytechnic and university settings, and past virtual world research had been most frequently carried out in the media arts and health and environment disciplines. Three main research topics were found: participants' affective domain, learning outcomes and social interaction. We conclude by summarising some major findings and discussing three limitations of previous empirical studies. Several recommendations for future research related to virtual worlds in education settings are also provided.},

  abstract = {The 21st century workplace is an increasingly intercultural and collaborative environment. As a result, soft skills are being recognized as deficient in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates. Our program, Purdue Polytechnic Leadership Academy seeks to improve essential workplace skills for STEM students through virtual reality (VR) simulations that immerse students in intercultural leadership case studies. Experiencing something from a distance is a new type of collaborative technology enabled by the internet of things known as telehora. Students will actively participate in the virtual environment, both responding to and looking around in the virtual environment. Students will experience firsthand how the choices they make within the modules change the outcomes of the case. Once developed, the modules can be deployed in traditional and online classrooms or as self-study. The modules can be scaled to provide a safe and replicable experience for large student cohorts, with potential to expand to multiple universities and industry. Students are unable to gain these experiences through formal education by other means, making the experiences good candidates for VR application. Virtual reality combined with sensors for emotion tracking represent a novel educational application of Internet of Things hardware. We will compare efficacy of high-cost VR hardware to low-cost VR and traditional computers, examining how student engagement and outcomes are affected by the different delivery mediums, thereby contributing to our understanding of these novel technologies. Research methods will include measures of intercultural competence, tolerance for ambiguity, facial emotion detection, and a combination of galvanic skin response and electromyography. This data triangulation will provide insights into the effectiveness of the interventions on traditional outcomes and give researchers a better understanding of emotion's role in intercultural leadership interactions. The provides an immersive and safe learning environment for students to participate in intercultural leadership scenarios that cannot be replicated in traditional classrooms.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) displays have become important for many applications including vision research, operation of remote devices, medical imaging, surgical training, scientific visualization, virtual prototyping, and more. In many of these applications, it is important for the graphic image to create a faithful impression of the 3D structure of the portrayed object or scene. Unfortunately, 3D displays often yield distortions in perceived 3D structure compared with the percepts of the real scenes the displays depict. A likely cause of such distortions is the fact that computer displays present images on one surface. Thus, focus cues-accommodation and blur in the retinal image-specify the depth of the display rather than the depths in the depicted scene. Additionally, the uncoupling of vergence and accommodation required by 3D displays frequently reduces one's ability to fuse the binocular stimulus and causes discomfort and fatigue for the viewer. We have developed a novel 3D display that presents focus cues that are correct or nearly correct for the depicted scene. We used this display to evaluate the influence of focus cues on perceptual distortions, fusion failures, and fatigue. We show that when focus cues are correct or nearly correct, (1) the time required to identify a stereoscopic stimulus is reduced, (2) stereoacuity in a time-limited task is increased, (3) distortions in perceived depth are reduced, and (4) viewer fatigue and discomfort are reduced. We discuss the implications of this work for vision research and the design and use of displays.},

Twenty years have been elapsed since we published a frequently cited, critical review of the research on the school science laboratory (Hofstein \& Lunetta, Rev. Educ. Res.52(2), 201--217, 1982). Twenty years later, we are living in an era of dramatic new technology resources and new standards in science education in which learning by inquiry has been given renewed central status. Methodologies for research and assessment that have developed in the last 20 years can help researchers seeking to understand how science laboratory resources are used, how students' work in the laboratory is assessed, and how science laboratory activities can be used by teachers to enhance intended learning outcomes. In that context, we take another look at the school laboratory in the light of contemporary practices and scholarship. This analysis examines scholarship that has emerged in the past 20 years in the context of earlier scholarship, contemporary goals for science learning, current models of how students construct knowledge, and information about how teachers and students engage in science laboratory activities. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We then propose the gestures-as-simulated-action framework to explain how gestures might arise from an embodied cognitive system. Finally, we compare this framework with other current models of gesture production, and we briefly outline predictions that derive from the framework.},

Many schools around the world have actively participated in the transformation and have included the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Many developed countries hope to combine the concept of STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) with interdisciplinary learning, and apply it to ESD. This study intended to integrate the sustainability concept into Virtual Reality (VR) system-aided STEAM education, in order to provide school children with integrated interdisciplinary STEAM education. A literature review was conducted and the research hypotheses were proposed. The empirical method and questionnaires were used as research methods to investigate the influence of the proposed system on the students' satisfaction, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes after cognition learning. The results of this study showed that the combination of STEAM education, with VR-aided experience courses, could help to improve the learning satisfaction and outcomes of students and to arouse their learning motivation. However, the proposed system needs an ESD that is based on students' traditional culture (such as designing a role-playing game), so that they can improve their self-efficacy through playing a VR game. Although VR games are interesting, they are difficult for some students to play. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the teaching materials, methods, and strategies appropriately by using information technology, so that ESD can be achieved by inspiring students to explore continuously. The findings can serve as a reference for further relevant studies.},

Although AR and VR technologies have been widely utilized in the educational domain, there remains a dearth of empirical research examining the differences in educational impact across AR and VR technologies. The purpose of our exploratory study was to address this gap in the literature by comparing AR and VR technologies with regard to their impact on learning outcomes, such as retention of science information. Specifically, we use a two-condition (AR vs. VR) betweensubjects' design to test college students' science-knowledge retention in response to both auditory and visual information presented on a Samsung S4 smartphone app. Our results (N = 109) suggest that VR is more immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence. However, AR seems to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through the pathway of spatial presence, possibly because of increased cognitive demands associated with immersive experiences. Thus, an important implication for design is that educational content should be integrated into visual modalities when the experience will be consumed in VR, but into auditory modalities when it will be consumed in AR.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among Taiwanese high school students' learning style, sense of presence, cognitive load, and affective and cognitive learning outcomes in an immersive virtual reality-based learning environment. This study used a teaching experiment intervention method. Seventy-seven students participated in the virtual reality-based learning environment and completed related scales and a test. This study found that although the students' learning style does not influence learning outcomes, it may influence the subjective sense of presence and cognitive load in the learning process. Regarding the affective learning outcome, involvement/immersion, sensory fidelity, and mental effort are positive predictors. In addition, involvement/immersion, interface quality, mental load, and mental effort are negative predictors of cognitive learning outcomes. The conclusion from this study is that students with some learning style preferences must bear a greater cognitive load to achieve the same learning outcomes as other students. This study also points out that the components of sense of presence and cognitive load generate inconsistent predictive effects on affective and cognitive learning outcomes, respectively. Therefore, it is important to deeply explore the influence of sense of presence and cognitive load structure on learning in virtual environments.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of biologically removing nitrate from groundwater was tested by using cyanobacterial cultures in batch mode under laboratory conditions. Results demonstrated that nitrate-contaminated groundwater, when supplemented with phosphate and some trace elements, can be used as growth medium supporting vigorous growth of several strains of cyanobacteria. As cyanobacteria grew, nitrate was removed from the water. Of three species tested, Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 displayed the highest nitrate uptake rate, but all species showed rapid removal of nitrate from groundwater. The nitrate uptake rate increased proportionally with increasing light intensity up to 100 {$\mu$}mol of photons m-2 s-1, which parallels photosynthetic activity. The nitrate uptake rate was affected by inoculum size (i.e., cell density), fixed-nitrogen level in the cells in the inoculum, and aeration rate, with vigorously aerated, nitrate-sufficient cells in mid-logarithmic phase having the highest long-term nitrate uptake rate. Average nitrate uptake rates up to 0.05 mM NO3- h-1 could be achieved at a culture optical density at 730 nm of 0.5 to 1.0 over a 2-day culture period. This result compares favorably with those reported for nitrate removal by other cyanobacteria and algae, and therefore effective nitrate removal from groundwater using this organism could be anticipated on large-scale operations.},

The application of VR technology for the Digital Humanities is only now beginning to receive attention, but more study needs to be conducted on its uses within various humanistic disciplines. In order to expand on the research at a pivotal time in education when modalities expand to incorporate more hybrid, distance education, and online learning, this study reviews the literature and theories behind the educational use of VR as a tool to reinforce learning outcomes in the field of art history. Through the review, theories and best practices are presented for practical adoption at various level of instruction at other institutions, as well as a list of recommendations for integrating VR technology specifically within art history instruction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a first study in which a recently reported intermodal perceptual illusion known as the rubber hand illusion is experimentally investigated under mediated conditions. When one's own hand is placed out of view and a visible fake hand is repeatedly stroked and tapped in synchrony with the unseen hand, subjects report a strong sense in which the fake hand is experienced as part of their own body. In our experiment, we investigated this illusion under three conditions: (i) unmediated condition, replicating the original paradigm, (ii) virtual reality (VR) condition, where both the fake hand and its stimulation were projected on the table in front of the participant, and (iii) mixed reality (MR) condition, where the fake hand was projected, but its stimulation was unmediated. Dependent measures included self-report (open-ended and questionnaire-based) and drift, that is, the offset between the felt position of the hidden hand and its actual position. As expected, the unmediated condition produced the strongest illusion, as indicated both by self-report and drift towards the rubber hand. The VR condition produced a more convincing subjective illusion than the MR condition, although no difference in drift was found between the mediated conditions. Results are discussed in terms of perceptual mechanisms underlying the rubber hand illusion, and the illusion's relevance to understanding telepresence.},

The possible roles algae, cyanobacteria, and lichens could play in arid environments include physical improvement and protection of the soil, contribution of nitrogen to the arid ecosystem by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and lichens, and primary biomass production for use as food and other secondary production. Physical improvement and protection of arid soils has potential in controlling desertification and rehabilitating arid lands. Culturing algae and cyanobacteria for biomass production, already being utilized in nonarid environments in agriculture, aquaculture, and now in the biochemical industry, has bright prospects in arid areas with their abundant sunshine. Primary production by the organisms can also be used for direct human and livestock consumption and in urban waste treatment. Biomass production can thus act as a means of resource diversification and therefore relieve pressure on fragile arid lands.},

  abstract = {Projects and project-based activities account for over 30\% of the global GPD and act as significant vehicles in the transition towards a more sustainable future. Sustainability strategies are typically enacted and implemented through projects in project-based organisations and firms. Incorporating sustainability principles into the project, product, and service management processes with successful project decision making is a challenging task and requires new personnel competencies and skills. Project sustainability management education requires the embedding of sustainability principles into project management education in a purposeful, integrative, innovative, and seamless manner. One way to facilitate this process is educational games. Active and experiential teaching methods will enable learning and practising complex project management activities in a simulative environment and are challenging at the same time. To extend knowledge of designing and using educational games for project sustainability management education, we explore the development and use of a novel educational game solution called the Project Business Game. It provides students and teachers with a computer game environment and game-based learning solution in which project planning, stakeholder management, cost management, decision making, and risk management skills can be enhanced by means of experiential, situational, and problem-based learning. The use of the game was explored in the context of educating European students of `Junior Expert in Circular Economy' on a blended learning course in spring 2021. Action design research was applied as a research method. The results describe the requirements and goals for the instruction and the game design process based on these needs and experiences of the implementation. The findings indicate the strong suitability of using game-based learning methods to teach project sustainability management and create positive student experiences of achieving learning goals and improving engagement.},

The current work exposes young children to novel `verbs' and objects through either (a) actively exploring the objects or (b) by seeing an experimenter interact with the objects. Results demonstrate that the motor system is recruited during auditory perception only after learning involved self-generated interactions with objects. Action observation itself led to above-baseline activation in one motor region during visual perception, but was still significantly less active than after self-generated action. Therefore, in the developing brain, associations are built upon real-world interactions of body and environment, leading to sensori-motor representations of both objects and words.},

These states include not only intending actions that will eventually be executed, but also imagining actions, recognizing tools, learning by observation, or even understanding the behavior of other people. Studies using techniques for mapping brain activity, probing cortical excitability, or measuring the activity of peripheral effectors in normal human subjects and in patients all provide evidence of a subliminal activation of the motor system during these cognitive states. The hypothesis that the motor system is part of a simulation network that is activated under a variety of conditions in relation to action, either self-intended or observed from other individuals, will be developed. The function of this process of simulation would be not only to shape the motor system in anticipation to execution, but also to provide the self with information on the feasibility and the meaning of potential actions.},

In contrast to N2, N2O was found to suppress nitrogenase-mediated H2 evolution completely at infinitely high pN2O. H2 was found to inhibit N2O-supported NH3 production but not N2O-supported N2 production. The steady-state kinetics of N2O reduction showed a good fit to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km for N2O of 5 mM at 30 degrees C, corresponding to 24 kPa of N2O.

The quality assessment shows that the study quality was below average according to the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, especially for the studies that were designed as user evaluations of educational VR products. The review identified a number of situations where HMDs are useful for skills acquisition. These include cognitive skills related to remembering and understanding spatial and visual information and knowledge; psychomotor skills related to head-movement, such as visual scanning or observational skills; and affective skills related to controlling your emotional response to stressful or difficult situations. Outside of these situations the HMDs had no advantage when compared to less immersive technologies or traditional instruction and in some cases even proved counterproductive because of widespread cybersickness, technological challenges, or because the immersive experience distracted from the learning task.},

Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students' gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings. We hypothesize that the positive results are due to the embodiment designed into the lessons and the high degree of collaboration engendered by the co-located EMRELE.},

  abstract = {Embodiment theory proposes that knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor systems, and that learning can be facilitated to the extent that lessons can be mapped to these systems. This study with 109 college-age participants addresses two overarching questions: (a) how are immediate and delayed learning gains affected by the degree to which a lesson is embodied, and (b) how do the affordances of three different educational platforms affect immediate and delayed learning? Six 50 min-long lessons on centripetal force were created. The first factor was the degree of embodiment with two levels: (1) low and (2) high. The second factor was platform with three levels: (1) a large scale "mixed reality" immersive environment containing both digital and hands-on components called SMALLab, (2) an interactive whiteboard system, and (3) a mouse-driven desktop computer. Pre-tests, post-tests, and 1-week follow-up (retention or delayed learning gains) tests were administered resulting in a 2 {\texttimes} 3 {\texttimes} 3 design. Two knowledge subtests were analyzed, one that relied on more declarative knowledge and one that relied on more generative knowledge, e.g., hand-drawing vectors. Regardless of condition, participants made significant immediate learning gains from pre-test to post-test. There were no significant main effects or interactions due to platform or embodiment on immediate learning. However, from post-test to follow-up the level of embodiment interacted significantly with time, such that participants in the high embodiment conditions performed better on the subtest devoted to generative knowledge questions. We posit that better retention of certain types of knowledge can be seen over time when more embodiment is present during the encoding phase. This sort of retention may not appear on more traditional factual/declarative tests. Educational technology designers should consider using more sensorimotor feedback and gestural congruency when designing and opportunities for instructor professional development need to be provided as well.},

The study assessed which variables predicted learning gains after a 1-h lesson on the electric field. The three manipulated variables were: (1) level of embodiment; (2) level of active generativity; and (3) presence of story narrative. Two types of tests were administered: (1) a traditional text-based physics test answered with a keyboard; and (2) a more embodied, transfer test using the Wacom large tablet where learners could use gestures (long swipes) to create vectors and answers. The 166 participants were randomly assigned to four conditions: (1) symbols and text; (2) low embodied; (3) high embodied/active; or (4) high embodied/active with narrative. The last two conditions were active because the on-screen content could be manipulated with gross body gestures gathered via the Kinect sensor. Results demonstrated that the three groups that included embodiment learned significantly more than the symbols and text group on the traditional keyboard post-test. When knowledge was assessed with the Wacom tablet format that facilitated gestures, the two active gesture-based groups scored significantly higher. In addition, engagement scores were significantly higher for the two active embodied groups. The Wacom results suggest test sensitivity issues; the more embodied test revealed greater gains in learning for the more embodied conditions. We recommend that as more embodied learning comes to the fore, more sensitive tests that incorporate gesture be used to accurately assess learning. The predicted differences in engagement and learning for the condition with the graphically rich story narrative were not supported. We hypothesize that a narrative effect for motivation and learning may be difficult to uncover in a lab experiment where participants are primarily motivated by course credit. Several design principles for mediated and embodied science education are proposed.},

Twenty-three 7th graders, playing as dyads, used gestures to manipulate virtual gears. The Kinect sensor tracked arm-spinning movements and switched gear diameters. Knowledge tests were administered. Statistically significant knowledge gains were seen. For Game 1 gear spun one direction, switching significantly predicted only pretest knowledge. For Game 2 gear spun two directions switching was also negatively correlated with both tests. For game 2, those who used fewer switches during gameplay understood the construct better scoring higher on both tests. Dyadic analyses revealed the winner used significantly fewer switches. In-process data can provide a window onto knowledge as it is being encoded. However, games should stay within the learner's ZPD, because if the game is too easy Game 1, meaningful data may be difficult to gather. The use of in ludo data from games with high sensitivity may attenuate the need for repetitive traditional, post-intervention tests.},

  abstract = {This article explores relevant applications of educational theory for the design of immersive virtual reality (VR). Two unique attributes associated with VR position the technology to positively affect education: (1) the sense of presence, and (2) the embodied affordances of gesture and manipulation in the 3rd dimension. These are referred to as the two profound affordances of VR. The primary focus of this article is on the embodiment afforded by gesture in 3D for learning. The new generation of hand controllers induces embodiment and agency via meaningful and congruent movements with the content to be learned. Several examples of gesture-rich lessons are presented. The final section includes an extensive set of design principles for immersive VR in education, and finishes with the Necessary Nine which are hypothesized to optimize the pedagogy within a lesson.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems face many simultaneous pressures due to human activities. Consequently, there has been a rapid loss of freshwater biodiversity and an increase in biomonitoring programs. Our study assessed the potential of benthic stream bacterial communities as indicators of multiple-stressor impacts associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification. We conducted a fully crossed four-factor experiment in 64 flow-through mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21~d of colonization, 21~d of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment, flow-velocity reduction and added fine sediment after 2 and 3~weeks of stressor exposure. We used high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques (16S rRNA genes), as well as curated biological databases (METAGENassit, MetaCyc), to identify changes in bacterial relative abundances and predicted metabolic functional profile. Sediment addition and flow-velocity reduction were the most pervasive stressors. They both increased {$\alpha$}-diversity and had strong taxon-specific effects on community composition and predicted functions. Sediment and flow velocity also interacted frequently, with 88\% of all bacterial response variables showing two-way interactions and 33\% showing three-way interactions including nutrient enrichment. Changes in relative abundances of common taxa were associated with shifts in dominant predicted functions, which can be extrapolated to underlaying stream-wide mechanisms such as carbon use and bacterial energy production pathways. Observed changes were largely stable over time and occurred after just 2~weeks of exposure, demonstrating that bacterial communities can be well-suited for early detection of multiple stressors. Overall, added sediment and reduced flow velocity impacted both bacterial community structure and predicted function more than nutrient enrichment. In future research and stream management, a holistic approach to studying multiple-stressor impacts should include multiple trophic levels with their functional responses, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of complex stressor effects and promote establishment of more efficient biomonitoring programs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Popularly used in marketing and business, gamification has been gaining interest in educational contexts for its potential to invigorate otherwise mundane or difficult processes. A gamified environment transfers motivational elements of games to learning activities thereby engaging learners in the learning task thus transforming dull classroom environments to smart ones. This paper presents the design process of a gamification intervention in geometry at elementary level, based upon Huang and Soman (Gamification of education. Research report series: behavioural economics in action, 29. Rothman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, 2013) model. We describe how insights from various sources helped us to refine an intervention previously used in one school. The design focuses on gamifying the tangram, an unplugged resource, through incorporating game-based elements of leader boards, points/stars and challenge levels to motivate young learners individually and in teams. Cognitive and motivational scaffolding undergird five challenge levels to bring affordances to self and social elements for learner participation in increasingly complex geometry tasks. There are limited theoretical models to guide educational researchers, especially ones that do not require digital resources. This paper presents our insights and recommendations to support scaffolded learning in student-centred gamified learning environments.},

Moreover, many students have problems with understanding issues connected to mechanical and electrical engineering due to the complexity, necessity of abstract thinking and the fact that those concepts are not fully tangible.  Many studies indicate that virtual reality can be successfully used as a training tool in various domains, such as development, health-care, the military or school education.  In this paper, an interactive training strategy for mechanical and electrical engineering education shall be proposed.  The prototype of the software consists of a simple interface, meaning it is easy for comprehension and use. Additionally, the main part of the prototype allows the user to virtually manipulate a 3D object that should be analyzed and studied. Initial studies indicate that the use of virtual reality can contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of higher education, as well as qualifications, competencies and the skills of graduates, and increase their competitiveness in the labour market.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is important as it allows to prioritize research into the causes of declines and assessing the efficacy of conservation measures. Regional assessments are valuable, because conservation policies and management are often implemented on national and sub-national level. We analyzed data from the German Common Bird Monitoring for 1990--2018. We derived indices of population size using standard log-linear models, based on point counts and route territory mapping at up to 1200 plots annually. We summarized species trends by ecological trait groups. Among the 93 common breeding birds, farmland birds declined strongly, birds of settlements declined. Forest birds initially declined, but recovered after ca. 2010. Wetland birds increased strongly, albeit the number of species with data was low. Consistent declines were found in ground-nesting birds, granivorous and invertebrate (other than insect)-feeding birds. Trends of insectivorous birds were stable on average, but farmland insectivores declined strongly since the year 2000. Long-distance migrants showed more negative trends compared to short-distance migrants and resident species. Species with narrow habitat niche declined disproportionally. Trends over the entire period were more negative in common species in the dataset (with a German breeding population of\,{$>$}\,50~K and\,{$<$}\,1~M pairs). On the opposite, short-term trends were more negative in less common species ({$<$}\,50~K pairs). Cold-adapted species showed largely negative, warm-adapted largely positive trends. Multi-species indicators showed no directional change (i.e., a change from decline to increase or vice versa) conditional on the inclusion or omission of single species, but the magnitude of change was affected in groups with low sample size. This suggests that efforts should be made to develop robust monitoring schemes for rarer species that are not covered by the analyses here. We conclude that conservation policies in Germany should aim at halting the worrying declines in ground-nesting, often insectivorous, farmland birds. The recovery of forest and wetland birds is encouraging, but future trends need to be monitored. Ongoing climate change will affect species directly (via their thermal niche) and indirectly (e.g., through more forest disturbance). Conservation strategies will, therefore, need to consider species adaptation to environmental and climate change, e.g., in better protected area connectivity and management.},

  abstract = {For the growing human population to be sustained during present climatic changes, enhanced quality and quantity of crops are essential to enable food security worldwide. The current consensus is that we need to make a transition from a petroleum-based to a bio-based economy via the development of a sustainable circular economy and biorefinery approaches. Both macroalgae (seaweeds) and microalgae have been long considered a rich source of plant biostimulants with an attractive business opportunity in agronomy and agro-industries. To date, macroalgae biostimulants have been well explored. In contrast, microalgal biostimulants whilst known to have positive effects on development, growth and yields of crops, their commercial implementation is constrained by lack of research and cost of production. The present review highlights the current knowledge on potential biostimulatory compounds, key sources and their quantitative information from algae. Specifically, we provide an overview on the prospects of microalgal biostimulants to advance crop production and quality. Key aspects such as specific biostimulant effects caused by extracts of microalgae, feasibility and potential of co-cultures and later co-application with other biostimulants/biofertilizers are highlighted. An overview of the current knowledge, recent advances and achievements on extraction techniques, application type, application timing, current market and regulatory aspects are also discussed. Moreover, aspects involved in circular economy and biorefinery approaches are also covered, such as: integration of waste resources and implementation of high-throughput phenotyping and -omics tools in isolating novel strains, exploring synergistic interactions and illustrating the underlying mode of microalgal biostimulant action. Overall, this review highlights the current and future potential of microalgal biostimulants, algal biochemical components behind these traits and finally bottlenecks and prospects involved in the successful commercialisation of microalgal biostimulants for sustainable agricultural practices.},

We explored this association in an ethnically diverse cohort of schoolchildren. Sex-stratified, linear random-effects modelling was used to examine how modelled residential exposure to annual average nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and ozone (O3), measures in {$\mu$}g/m3, associated with blood pressure. Estimates were based on 3,284 adolescents; 80\% from ethnic minority groups, recruited from 51 schools, and followed up from 11--13 to 14--16 years old. Ethnic minorities were exposed to higher modelled annual average concentrations of pollution at residential postcode level than their White UK peers. A two-pollutant model (NO2 \& PM2.5), adjusted for ethnicity, age, anthropometry, and pubertal status, highlighted associations with systolic, but not diastolic BP. A {$\mu$}g/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with a 0.30 mmHg (95\% CI 0.18 to 0.40) decrease in systolic BP for girls and 0.19 mmHg (95\% CI 0.07 to 0.31) decrease in systolic BP for boys. In contrast, a 1 {$\mu$}g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with 1.34 mmHg (95\% CI 0.85 to 1.82) increase in systolic BP for girls and 0.57 mmHg (95\% CI 0.04 to 1.03) increase in systolic BP for boys. Associations did not vary by ethnicity, body size or socio-economic advantage. Associations were robust to adjustments for noise levels and lung function at 11--13 years. In summary, higher ambient levels of NO2 were associated with lower and PM2.5 with higher systolic BP across adolescence, with stronger associations for girls.},

I examine 40 autoethnographies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2020. The findings show that a large number of the researchers employed autoethnography as ``an umbrella term'' without opting for a specific type of autoethnography. Second, a great majority of the autoethnographers diverted from traditional third-person academic prose, although most of them approached their stories with an analytic lens. Third, the absence or scarcity of (auto)biographical information decreased both the evocative and analytic qualities of autoethnographic studies. Lastly, the authors provided little or no justification of their methodological choices as to why they specifically opted for autoethnography rather than other qualitative methodologies. Likewise, most authors provided little or no explanation about their selection of data collection tools and procedures as well as their data analysis methods and strategies. In light of these findings, I suggest future autoethnographers familiarize themselves with the types, epistemological foundations, and methodological affordances of autoethnography so that they may find the most appropriate voice and affordances to tell their stories in their own way.},

Their cultivation in conjunction with material and nutrient recycling represent a considerable opportunity as part of a regenerative economic system for exploitation of recycled matter, called the ``circular economy''. In recent years, there has been considerable discussion about the potential of microalgae as feedstock for renewable biofuels, but there may be other diverse commercial opportunities for microalgae. A range of high-value products such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), pigments, and others bioactive compounds are useful as nutraceuticals and cosmetics, as well as for industrial purposes. However, unexplored natural sources of bioactive molecules from microalgae are gaining much attention since they can lead to the discovery of new compounds or bioactivities. In terms of environmental biotechnology, microalgae have a major role to play particularly for the treatment of agro-industrial wastewater, and against numerous pollutants such as heavy metal or pesticides. The present review has been prepared to update the potential of microalgae biomass for biotechnological applications other than biofuels.},

A simplified channel flow model is used to allow analysis using a Cartesian set of coordinates. Finite analytic (FA) numerical simulation of the flow field inside the channel was performed to study the influence of Reynolds number and pressure gradient on velocity distribution and shear stresses across the channel cross-section. Simulation results were used to predict flow rates, circulatory flow and the shear stresses, which are known to be related to the level of red blood cell damage (hemolysis) caused by the pump. The study shows that high shear levels are confined to small regions within the channel cross-section, but the circulatory nature of the flow causes an increased percentage of blood elements to pass through the high shear regions, and increases the likelihood of cell damage.},

Adopting multiple case study methods, we examined the digital stories of five students, together with classroom observations and interviews about their experiences, in order to explore how digital storytelling can allowed students to reflect upon their experiences in a year-end capstone program. Creating digital stories allowed students to 1) reflect on their learning experiences teaching younger students with virtual reality, 2) present their reflections in multiple modalities, and 3) make connections between their present experiences and the past and future. This study demonstrates how digital storytelling can enable multimodal reflection for middle school students, particularly within technology-focused project-based learning environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers possibilities of creating a learner-centric environment that can provide more presence and engagement for students leading to an enhanced learning experience compared to conventional classroom practices. However, the potential of IVR in vocational education and training (VET) has not yet been explored in-depth, and it is an open question of whether it can effectively support learner creation in a designing task. In this paper, we present an IVR application developed to support gardener apprentices in designing gardens. Using this application, we conducted an experimental study with gardener apprentices to investigate the effect of the IVR interface compared to paper sketching and learner behavior on the proportion, composition, and creativity of the design outcome. Additionally, we investigated how it can be combined with a paper sketching activity to improve its effectiveness. Our analysis shows that the IVR interface can be more effective for the proportion aspect, but this may be limited to students that are able to use it after working with paper. In terms of the combination order, the effectiveness of IVR on the design quality was improved when it was carried out after the paper sketching and this ordering produced a more effective outcome for the proportion and composition aspects. Finally, our results show that IVR design quality is related to learner behaviors such as the time spent on designing and the number of simulations used. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of IVR applications in supporting designing skills and how effectiveness can be improved by combining it with a conventional method of practice.

IVR enhances learning through situated experience, multiple perspectives, and simulations that transfer to the real world.

The use of IVR may have a significant impact on the quality of design outcomes.

This recognises the value of alternative episte\- mological views and the way they can contribute to professional devel\- opment. An explicit recognition of this challenge may provide a tool to support bioscience researchers to become integrated academics and relieve some of the tensions that exist, for example between teaching and research.},

  abstract = {Since the first time the term "Virtual Reality" (VR) has been used back in the 60s, VR has evolved in different manners becoming more and more similar to the real world. Two different kinds of VR can be identified: non-immersive and immersive. The former is a computer-based environment that can simulate places in the real or imagined worlds; the latter takes the idea even further by giving the perception of being physically present in the non-physical world. While non-immersive VR can be based on a standard computer, immersive VR is still evolving as the needed devices are becoming more user friendly and economically accessible. In the past, there was a major difficulty about using equipment such as a helmet with goggles, while now new devices are being developed to make usability better for the user. VR, which is based on three basic principles: Immersion, Interaction, and User involvement with the environment and narrative, offers a very high potential in education by making learning more motivating and engaging. Up to now, the use of immersive-VR in educational games has been limited due to high prices of the devices and their limited usability. Now new tools like the commercial "Oculus Rift", make it possible to access immersive-VR in lots of educational situations. This paper reports a survey on the scientific literature on the advantages and potentials in the use of Immersive Virtual Reality in Education in the last two years (2013-14). It shows how VR in general, and immersive VR in particular, has been used mostly for adult training in special situations or for university students. It then focuses on the possible advantages and drawbacks of its use in education with reference to different classes of users like children and some kinds of cognitive disabilities (with particular reference to the Down syndrome). It concludes outlining strategies that could be carried out to verify these ideas.},

The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide "internal" guidance.

  abstract = {Roughly 20\% of the European Union's farmland is under some form of agri-environment scheme to counteract the negative impacts of modern agriculture on the environment. The associated costs represent about 4\% (1.7 billion euros) of the European Union's total expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy and are expected to rise to 10\% in the near future. Although agri-environment schemes have been implemented in various countries for well over a decade, to date no reliable, sufficiently replicated studies have been performed to test whether such measures have the presumed positive effects on biodiversity. Here we present the results of a study evaluating the contribution of agri-environment schemes to the protection of biodiversity in intensively used Dutch agricultural landscapes. We surveyed plants, birds, hover flies and bees on 78 paired fields that either had agri-environment schemes in the form of management agreements or were managed conventionally. Management agreements were not effective in protecting the species richness of the investigated species groups: no positive effects on plant and bird species diversity were found. The four most common wader species were observed even less frequently on fields with management agreements. By contrast, hover flies and bees showed modest increases in species richness on fields with management agreements. Our results indicate that there is a pressing need for a scientifically sound evaluation of agri-environment schemes.},

  abstract = {1 Increasing concern over the environmental impact of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes. These schemes compensate farmers financially for any loss of income associated with measures that aim to benefit the environment or biodiversity. There are currently agri-environment schemes in 26 out of 44 European countries. 2 Agri-environment schemes vary markedly between countries even within the European Union. The main objectives include reducing nutrient and pesticide emissions, protecting biodiversity, restoring landscapes and preventing rural depopulation. In virtually all countries the uptake of schemes is highest in areas of extensive agriculture where biodiversity is still relatively high and lowest in intensively farmed areas where biodiversity is low. 3 Approximately {\texteuro}24{$\cdot$}3 billion has been spent on agri-environment schemes in the European Union (EU) since 1994, an unknown proportion of it on schemes with biodiversity conservation aims. We carried out a comprehensive search for studies that test the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in published papers or reports. Only 62 evaluation studies were found originating from just five EU countries and Switzerland (5). Indeed 76\% of the studies were from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where until now only c. 6\% of the EU agri-environmental budget has been spent. Other studies were from Germany (6), Ireland (3) and Portugal (1). 4 In the majority of studies, the research design was inadequate to assess reliably the effectiveness of the schemes. Thirty-one percent did not contain a statistical analysis. Where an experimental approach was used, designs were usually weak and biased towards giving a favourable result. The commonest experimental design (37\% of the studies) was a comparison of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes and control areas. However, there is a risk of bias if either farmers or scheme co-ordinators select the sites for agri-environment schemes. In such cases the sites are likely to have a higher biodiversity at the outset compared to the controls. This problem may be addressed by collecting baseline data (34\% of studies), comparing trends (32\%) or changes (26\%) in biodiversity between areas with and without schemes or by pairing scheme and control sites that experience similar environmental conditions (16\%). 5 Overall, 54\% of the examined species (groups) demonstrated increases and 6\% decreases in species richness or abundance compared with controls. Seventeen percent showed increases for some species and decreases for other species, while 23\% showed no change at all in response to agri-environment schemes. The response varied between taxa. Of 19 studies examining the response of birds that included a statistical analysis, four showed significant increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and nine showed both increases and decreases. Comparative figures for 20 arthropod studies yielded 11 studies that showed an increase in species richness or abundance, no study showed a decrease and three showed both increases and decreases. Fourteen plant studies yielded six studies that showed increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and no study showed both increases and decreases. 6 Synthesis and applications. The lack of robust evaluation studies does not allow a general judgement of the effectiveness of European agri-environment schemes. We suggest that in the future, ecological evaluations must become an integral part of any scheme, including the collection of baseline data, the random placement of scheme and control sites in areas with similar initial conditions, and sufficient replication. Results of these studies should be collected and disseminated more widely, in order to identify the approaches and prescriptions that best deliver biodiversity enhancement and value for money from community support.},

This promise is twofold: First, we can harness advancements made in sensing technologies to create immersive experiences of places across the earth efficiently; second, we can provide detailed empirical evaluations on immersive learning and quantify educational value. We report on a study that splits an introductory geosciences course into two groups with one group experiencing a traditional field trip, while a second group visits the same site virtually, immersing the students in the site using a head-mounted device. Results show the advantages of virtual field trips (VFTs) concerning enjoyment, learning experience, and actual lab scores. We embed the discussion of these results into a more general assessment of the advantages of VFTs and a taxonomy of VFTs as a basis for future studies.},

AR-based applications targeting the educational sector are becoming ever more available with even low-cost smartphones supporting visualization of AR content. Regardless of the fact that the number of downloads of these applications exceeds millions, and assuming they are used in educational settings, we still lack longitudinal reports on how AR affects learning outcomes (compared to other technologies).

  abstract = {The notion of using video games for learning causes some to cringe, others to leap for joy, and many to ask questions about this learning medium. These questions often come from people and organizations that are considering delving into the world of learning games but dont know if this is advisable or dont know where to start. The goal of this paper is to answer those questions about learning games and to help plot a path for people and organizations interested in developing or fostering the development of video games for learning. The paper starts by making a case for learning games grounded in principles of good fun and good learning. From there the paper explores the commercial games market, gleaning lessons from this rapidly growing and diversifying place. In order to address the concerns of those who see edutainment as a dead market, the paper analyzes the downfall of edutainment in the 1990s and establishes how the current movement differs. As there are many applications of games related (more or less) to learning games, the paper lays out the ecology of games with a purpose beyond play. Much of the rest of the paper establishes principles and best practices for moving the field forward in a positive direction. The paper should provide a good grounding in the field and both motivate and inform those wanting to participate in this rapidly growing domain.

The medial-conceptional distinction accounts, for example, for important problems on the level of discourse typology, comprising, for instance, 'elaborated' types of primary orality, communicative dynamics in medieval societies, modern types of electronic communication (e-mail, SMS message, chat), etc. Once it is to clearly tell the medial f r o m the conceptional aspect of language, it is, of course, legitimate to observe the most interesting interactions between these two. The idea of a conceptional continuum between communicative 'immediacy' and 'distance' constitutes also an important contribution to variational linguistics and sociolinguistics. It can be shown that this continuum is not only one dimension of linguistic variation, but the central principle underlying the organisation of variational spaces (within one language) and of communicative spaces (involving more than one language). Moreover, the medial-conceptional distinction reveals to be of paramount importance to a modern conception of language history as observing the transformation of whole variational spaces. The questions that can be dealt with here comprise the way to literacy, processes of elaboration, {\"U}berdachung, standardization, codification, reorganization of variational spaces, etc. as well as several types of language change. Finally, a clear conceptualization of medial and conceptional problems is indispensable for a sound methodology in corpus linguistics.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic prokaryotes that find a wide range of applications in industry due to their broad product spectrum. In this context, the application of cyanobacteria as biofertilizers and thus as an alternative to artificial fertilizers has emerged in recent decades. The benefit is mostly based on the ability of cyanobacteria to fix elemental nitrogen and make it available to the plants in a usable form. However, the positive effects of co-cultivating plants with cyanobacteria are not limited to the provision of nitrogen. Cyanobacteria produce numerous secondary metabolites that can be useful for plants, for example, they can have growth-promoting effects or increase resistance to plant diseases. The effects of biotic and abiotic stress can as well be reduced by many secondary metabolites. Furthermore, the biofilms formed by the cyanobacteria can lead to improved soil conditions, such as increased water retention capacity. To exchange the substances mentioned, cyanobacteria form symbioses with plants, whereby the strength of the symbiosis depends on both partners, and not every plant can form symbiosis with every cyanobacterium. Not only the plants in symbiosis benefit from the cyanobacteria, but also vice versa. This review summarizes the beneficial effects of cyanobacterial co-cultivation on plants, highlighting the substances exchanged and the strength of cyanobacterial symbioses with plants. A detailed explanation of the mechanism of nitrogen fixation in cyanobacterial heterocysts is given. Finally, a summary of possible applications of co-cultivation in the (agrar-)industry is given.},

We reasoned that students' understanding of science concepts such as torque and angular momentum is aided by activation of sensorimotor brain systems that add kinetic detail and meaning to students' thinking. We tested whether physical experience with angular momentum increases involvement of sensorimotor brain systems during students' subsequent reasoning and whether this involvement aids their understanding. The physical experience, a brief exposure to forces associated with angular momentum, significantly improved quiz scores. Moreover, improved performance was explained by activation of sensorimotor brain regions when students later reasoned about angular momentum. This finding specifies a mechanism underlying the value of physical experience in science education and leads the way for classroom practices in which experience with the physical world is an integral part of learning.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality displays, such as head-mounted displays (HMD), afford us a superior spatial awareness by leveraging our vestibular and proprioceptive senses, as compared to traditional desktop displays. Since classical times, people have used memory palaces as a spatial mnemonic to help remember information by organizing it spatially and associating it with salient features in that environment. In this paper, we explore whether using virtual memory palaces in a head-mounted display with head-tracking (HMD condition) would allow a user to better recall information than when using a traditional desktop display with a mouse-based interaction (desktop condition). We found that virtual memory palaces in HMD condition provide a superior memory recall ability compared to the desktop condition. We believe this is a first step in using virtual environments for creating more memorable experiences that enhance productivity through better recall of large amounts of information organized using the idea of virtual memory palaces.},

There are many surveys in the field of digital serious games; however, most surveys are specific to a particular area such as education or health. So far, there has been little work done to survey digital serious games in general, which is the main goal of this paper. Hence, we discuss relevant work on serious games in different application areas including education, well-being, advertisement, cultural heritage, interpersonal communication, and health care. We also propose a taxonomy for digital serious games, and we suggest a classification of reviewed serious games applications from the literature against the defined taxonomy. Finally, the paper provides guidelines, drawn from the literature, for the design and development of successful serious games, as well as discussing research perspectives in this domain.},

Thus, it supports a circular economy model. This is based on the ability of microalgae to utilise inorganic nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorous, as well as organic and inorganic carbon, for their growth, and simultaneously reduce these substances in the water. However, the production of microalgae biomass under outdoor cultivation is dependent on several abiotic and biotic factors, which impact its profitability and sustainability. Thus, this study's goal was to evaluate the factors affecting the production of microalgae biomass on pilot-scale open raceway ponds under Northern Sweden's summer conditions with the help of a mathematical model. For this purpose, a microalgae consortium and a monoculture of Chlorella vulgaris were used to inoculate outdoor open raceway ponds. In line with the literature, higher biomass concentrations and nutrient removals were observed in ponds inoculated with the microalgae consortium. Our model, based on Droop's concept of macronutrient quotas inside the cell, corresponded well to the experimental data and, thus, can successfully be applied to predict biomass production, nitrogen uptake and storage, and dissolved oxygen production in microalgae consortia.},

In total, 670 articles from 5 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, IEEE, and ERIC) were examined. Based on the results, using augmented reality and gamification in education can yield several benefits for students, assist educators, improve the educational process, and facilitate the transition toward technology-enhanced learning when used in a student-centered manner, following proper educational approaches and strategies and taking students' knowledge, interests, unique characteristics, and personality traits into consideration. Students demonstrated positive behavioral, attitudinal, and psychological changes and increased engagement, motivation, active participation, knowledge acquisition, focus, curiosity, interest, enjoyment, academic performance, and learning outcomes. Teachers also assessed them positively. Virtual rewards were crucial for improving learning motivation. The need to develop appropriate validation tools, design techniques, and theories was apparent. Finally, their potential to create collaborative and personalized learning experiences and to promote and enhance students' cognitive and social--emotional development was evident.},

In addition to virtual reality, this study focuses on gamified virtual reality learning environments which refer to virtual reality learning environments that integrate gamification elements and mechanisms. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a systematic literature review was carried out. No limitations were set regarding educational level, type of study, subject, and publication year. The related articles were retrieved from 5 databases (ERIC, Google Scholar, IEEE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science). A total of 112 articles were included, 16 research questions were explored, and a thematic analysis was conducted. To evaluate the quality of the articles included, the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used. According to the findings, gamification and virtual reality support several pedagogical theories and approaches. Their adoption to and integration into education can enrich and transform traditional teaching and learning and were assessed positively by students and teachers. Gamification elements significantly affected students' achievements. In comparison to traditional learning environments, gamified virtual reality learning environments were more motivating, engaging, and interactive and offered more opportunities for personalized and collaborative learning. Through the realistic and interactive experiences offered, students' immersion and social presence can be enhanced, knowledge acquisition can be improved, and material comprehension can be facilitated. Positive changes in student attitude, behavior, and mentality as well as improved cognitive, physical, and social--emotional development were observed. When using learning environments that integrate both virtual reality and gamification, students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and self-efficacy were increased. Additionally, students' academic performance, active involvement, and satisfaction were improved. Students' curiosity, imagination, focus, and interest were enhanced and their skills and competences were developed. Finally, gamified virtual reality emerged as an effective educational tool that can improve learning at all educational levels, subjects, and contexts.},

In this article, I reframe this definition in terms of the game attribute taxonomy presented by Bedwell and colleagues. This linking is done with the goal of aligning the research literatures of serious games and gamification. A psychological theory of gamified learning is developed and explored.                                         Conclusion               In the theory of gamified learning, gamification is defined as the use of game attributes, as defined by the Bedwell taxonomy, outside the context of a game with the purpose of affecting learning-related behaviors or attitudes. These behaviors/attitudes, in turn, influence learning by one or two processes: by strengthening the relationship between instructional design quality and outcomes (a moderating process) and/or by influencing learning directly (a mediating process). This is contrasted with a serious games approach in which manipulation of game attributes is typically intended to affect learning without this type of behavioral mediator/moderator. Examples of each game attribute category as it might be applied in gamification are provided, along with specific recommendations for the rigorous, scientific study of gamification.},

Resolution better than this is not attainable in compound eyes of realistic size. The smaller the interommatidial angle the greater the distance at which objects---prey, predators, or foliage---can be resolved. Insects with different lifestyles have contrasting patterns of interommatidial angle distribution, related to forward flight, capture on the wing, and predation on horizontal surfaces.},

Instructional writings like the OBPG are fruitful documents from which theories of practice can be extracted and, for companies like Oculus, they serve as alternative mission statements, articulating what Oculus wants and needs the standards and practices of its nascent product-medium to be. The author argues that the OBPG serves to create standards and practices that emphasize and maintain virtual reality (VR) user immersion in order to mitigate the weaknesses in the technology and better conform with VR?s idealized, hypothetical presentation in fiction and marketing rhetoric. The Guide plays a key role in Oculus?s larger attempts to mitigate market risk through the standardization of content across its distribution platforms in order to shape an inchoate technological object into a stable and lucrative entertainment medium. More broadly, the OBPG serves as an example of the specific ways in which market forces act on the development of new media practices, turning ?standards? into ?industry standards?.},

  abstract = {From the cell to the photobioreactor and to the industrial exploitation of microalgae, through the controlled experiments and modelling.           ,              A microorganism culture process is a complex system in which physical operating parameters and biological responses strongly interact. Mathematical formulation and modelling of the different phenomena involved in the process enable a better understanding of the behaviour of the process, and therefore enable the process parameters to be defined accordingly. The contribution of a model, even a simple one, is highly beneficial to the understanding of the process. The definition of a model for the particular case of photobioreactors is not easy, however, and requires the integration of multiple and often complex knowledge. This article reports a review on the biological aspects of the photosynthetic microorganisms culture necessary to model kinetic growths, the designs of photobioreactor used for deep analysis of the physiologic aspects of the microalgae culture and for the industrial culture. The different approaches to model the kinetic growth are described together with the modelling of the radiative field and its coupling to a simple biological model in order to illustrate the particular influence of the light factor, which is the main specific feature of photobioreactors.},

  abstract = {The nitrogen cycle is one of the most important biogeochemical cycles on Earth because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all life forms. To supplement natural nitrogen fixation, farmers add large amounts of nitrogen-containing fertilizer to their soils such that nitrogen never becomes a limiting nutrient for plant growth. However, of the nitrogen added to fields --- most of which is in the form of NH3 and NO3- --- only 30--50\% is taken up by plants, while the remainder is~metabolized by soil microorganisms in processes with detrimental environmental impacts. The~first of these processes, that is, nitrification, refers to the biological oxidation of NH3 to NO2- and NO3-, which have low retention in soil and pollute waterways, leading to downstream eutrophication and ultimately `dead zones' (low oxygen zones) in coastal waters, for example, the~Gulf of Mexico. In a second process, namely, denitrification, NO3- and NO2- undergo stepwise reduction to N2O and N2. Substantial amounts of the N2O produced in this process escape into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and ozone destruction. Recent results suggest that nitrification also affords N2O. This Review describes the enzymes involved in NH3 oxidation and N2O production and degradation in the nitrogen cycle. We pay particular attention to the active site structures, the associated coordination chemistry that enables the chemical transformations and the reaction mechanisms.},

With the current shift in focus towards making scientific writing more accessible, there is less certainty on the extent of passive use in the modern era. Although the use of the active voice is presently encouraged, the findings from available studies are mixed. There are also few diachronic studies involving recent articles. This present study investigated the trend in passive use from the nineteenth century to the present day using 80 articles from a multidisciplinary science journal covering four time periods (1880, 1930, 1980, and 2017). The study found that the extent of passive use was stable from 1880 to 1980 (occurring in about 29--36\% of all clauses) but declined in 2017 (averaging below 25\%). The study also found a decline in the use of finite passives to describe methodological actions and a corresponding increase in the use of first-person pronouns in the 2017 articles. Further work involving a larger corpus and an understanding of writer decisions in the composing process is needed.},

With its sense of presence and immersion, VR constructs an experiential learning process for students involving incidental vocabulary acquisition to promote their learning engagement and performance. Therefore, this study applied an experiential learning-based VR approach to an English for Geography course in a university. Thirty-six geography students participated in vocabulary acquisition on the theme of the hydrologic cycle. For the experiment, 18 students were assigned to the experimental group learning with the VR-based approach, while the other 18 were assigned to the control group learning with the video-based approach. The findings demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of incidental vocabulary acquisition and cognitive, behavioral, and social engagement.},

However, existing research on embodied learning technologies has been disparate, driven largely by specific technical innovations and constraints, and often lacking a clear focus on establishing their efficacy in educational contexts. On the basis of the unique characteristics of these technologies and on their own experiences conducting research in this area, the authors put forth six precepts for embodied learning technology researchers that pertain to the rationale, design, and...},

This thesis has explored how teachers relate to the discourse of arguments surrounding educational games and game based learning, with a focus on what teachers consider to be 'educational' regarding games and what they view as meaningful usage of games in educational settings.  Twelve teachers in the Swedish school system, ranging from preschool teachers to upper secondary school teachers, were interviewed. They were encouraged to approach educational games and game based learning from their perspectives and personal experiences. The interviewees' answers were interpreted using a qualitative content analysis, and the results reported in the form of thematically organized chapters, to highlight similarities and differences in their arguments.  The arguments expressed were analyzed from a game design perspective, to uncover how teachers reason in regard to what importance the design has for games' ability to lead to meaningful learning.  The findings suggest that teachers perceive the boundary between what can be considered educational and non-educational games as indistinct and fuzzy. The teachers rarely see that the design of a game can make it more or less suitable for learning purposes. Instead, how games are used by a teacher during a lesson is regarded as more important than what specific games are used and how such games are designed. The findings also confirm that the interviewees carry many of the arguments and perspectives that are commonly expressed in the popular discourse that surrounds educational games and game based learning.},

To obtain data, we administered a survey to 56 in-service mathematics teachers in primary and secondary education from these countries. The survey had been previously validated throughout an expert judgement process. Our results show a high percentage of teachers who think this kind of activity has positive effects on students' development, improving their affective domain toward mathematics and required skills for mathematical competency. Notwithstanding, many teachers report insecurity and lack of training for employing such educational methodologies.},

  abstract = {Gas exchange is a critical component of any biogeochemical mass balance model of dissolved gases in aquatic systems, yet the magnitude and drivers of spatial and temporal variations of air-water exchange rates in shallow streams are poorly understood. We investigated the relationships between gas exchange velocity of carbon dioxide and methane and flow hydraulics at different sections along a third order stream in Southwest Germany. To cover a wide range of different flow conditions, the sections were selected based on visual categorization of the dominant surface flow type. We found that in smooth and rippled flows, gas exchange velocities followed a universal dependence on turbulent dissipation rates predicted by the small-eddy and surface renewal models. For these surface flow types, the scaling applied to both, bulk-scale dissipation rates estimated from flow geometry and dissipation rates estimated from turbulence measurements. Turbulence was strongly anisotropic under rough flow conditions and gas exchange velocities were lower than predicted from measured dissipation rates. Nevertheless, near-surface turbulence and gas exchange velocities differed among surface flow type categories, indicating that quantitative assessment and mapping of surface flow type may facilitate improved parameterizations of gas exchange velocities at larger spatial scales. We further describe a novel instrument facilitating an objective assessment of surface flow by measuring the acceleration of a small floating sphere drifting freely on the water surface. In combination, our findings may open a new road for understanding, measuring and predicting spatial and temporal variability of gas exchange in streams.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Stream networks have recently been discovered to be major but poorly constrained natural greenhouse gas (GHG) sources. A fundamental problem is that several measurement approaches have been used without cross-comparisons. Flux chambers represent a potentially powerful methodological approach if robust and reliable ways to use chambers on running water can be defined. Here we compare the use of anchored and freely drifting chambers on various streams with different flow velocities. The study clearly shows that (1) anchored chambers enhance turbulence under the chambers and thus elevate fluxes, (2) drifting chambers have a very small impact on the water turbulence under the chamber and thus generate more reliable fluxes, (3) the bias of the anchored chambers greatly depends on chamber design and sampling conditions, and (4) there is a promising method to reduce the bias from anchored chambers by using a flexible plastic foil collar to seal the chambers to the water surface, rather than having rigid chamber walls penetrating into the water. Altogether, these results provide novel guidance on how to apply flux chambers in running water, which will have important consequences for measurements to constrain the global GHG balances.},

Several studies highlighted their pedagogical value, knowledge transfer and learners' engaged-behaviors. In this paper, we draw the characteristics of these learning games based on the integration of new technologies according to two characteristics: immersion and persistence. To investigate the impact of such technological components, we developed a game and evaluated it in ecological conditions. Four groups of fifteen high school students played the game through two testing conditions: two groups used a prototype allowing only classical interactions limited on usual devices, while the two other groups used a prototype integrating persistent and immersive interactions using Oculus Rift vision. All the interactions were recorded and their analysis suggests more engaged behaviors from students using the immersive and persistent prototype.},

The processing requirements of conventionally designed instructional animations are too often poorly aligned with the characteristics of human perceptual and cognitive capacities. Five animation principles that can help animations fulfil their educational potential are described and exemplified. However, in order to make major improvements in effectiveness, conventional ways of designing animations need to be replaced by fresh approaches that take proper account of learners' capacities. The Animation Processing Model provides an informed basis for principled animation design and opens up new possibilities by emphasizing internal rather than external representation.},

Around the world, collaborative science-society initiatives are forming to conduct experiments in support of sustainability transitions. Such experiments, if carefully designed, provide significant learning opportunities for making progress on transition efforts. Yet, there is no broadly applicable evaluative scheme available to capture this critical information across a large number of cases, and to guide the design of transition experiments. To address this gap, the article develops such a scheme, in a tentative form, drawing on evaluative research and sustainability transitions scholarship, alongside insights from empirical cases. We critically discuss the scheme's key features of being generic, comprehensive, operational, and formative. Furthermore, we invite scholars and practitioners to apply, reflect and further develop the proposed tentative scheme e making evaluation and experiments objects of learning.},

The propensity of NOx and NH3 to generate ozone and fine particulate matter and associated impacts on health are highly variable, whereas the climate impacts of long-lived N2O are independent of emission timing and location. However, these impacts have rarely been compared on a spatially resolved monetized basis. In this study, we update the nitrogen scheme in an agroecosystem model to simulate the Nr emissions from fertilized soils across the contiguous United States. We then apply a reduced-form air pollution health effect model to assess air quality impacts from NOx and NH3 and a social cost of N2O to assess the climate impacts. Assuming an \$8.2 million value of a statistical life and a \$13,100/ton social cost of N2O, the air quality impacts are a factor of {$\sim$}7 to 15 times as large as the climate impacts in heavily populated coastal regions, whereas the ratios are closer to 2.5 in sparsely populated regions. Our results show that air pollution, health, and climate should be considered jointly in future assessments of how farming practices affect Nr emissions.},

A total of 149 articles were selected from three major academic databases using search strings and manual screening protocols. The literature analysis emphasized four interrelated aspects of VR-based instruction: instructional context, instructional design, technological affordances, and research findings. The results revealed evolving trends in the VR literature in terms of publication patterns, pedagogical assumptions, equipment usage, and research methodologies, as well as the contextual factors behind VR adoption in education. Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy of VR-based instruction, with results indicating an overall medium effect and several moderating factors.

  abstract = {Serious environmental management games can improve understanding of practical environmental sustainability challenges by offering opportunities to obtain first-hand experiences that may be otherwise too costly, difficult or dangerous to reproduce in reality. Game-based learning (GBL) has been found to increase soft skills, such as critical thinking, creative problem solving and teamwork, as well as to improve cognitive development, learning retention and social learning, which are important for future environmental researchers and professionals. Environmental management games can be applied in educational settings to promote awareness about sustainable resource planning and management among citizens who are increasingly exposed to products of the information age. This paper provides an overview of game-based learning and the state of serious games (SG) for environmental management, offering insight into their potential as effective tools in facilitating environmental education. SGs have been shown to possess numerous qualities that have been connected with improved learning experiences and cognitive development, but research must continue to study the SGs' efficacy. Shortcomings found with games reviewed are that few evaluate or explain pedagogical foundation, and many are hard to implement or not accessible. Methods employed in determining the effectiveness of SGs vary greatly among environmental studies, necessitating a standardized methodology to reduce disparities in testing procedures. Furthermore, a centralized source, effectively an online database for SGs, is needed for locating and obtaining information pertaining to the available environmental games and their most appropriate applications.},

The composition of the cells was not altered appreciably by the short exposure to nitrate or ammonia. The distribution of N15 among these compounds was very similar, regardless of the source of nitrogen. The organisms grew well on nitrate or ammonia, and from nitrate they produced ammonia with a high level of N15. The nitrate culture had a notably high concentration of N15 in cytosine, guanine, uracil, and xanthine. The distribution of N15 in Nostoc muscorum was very much like that found earlier in other nitrogen-fixing agents, a result which emphasizes the unity of the nitrogen fixation process in widely different organisms. An adaptation period, as with Azotobacter vinelandii, was required before Nostoc muscorum could utilize nitrate. In one instance nitrite accumulated in the medium while the cells were using nitrate. No detectable free amino acids were excreted into the medium, but after hydrolysis of the culture supernatant ninhydrin positive material corresponding to about 5 per cent of the total nitrogen fixed was observed.},

Recent studies have considered whether it is possible to change our implicit social bias by experimentally changing the relationship between the self and outgroups. In a number of experimental studies, participants have been exposed to bodily illusions that induced ownership over a body different to their own with respect to gender, age, or race. Ownership of an outgroup body has been found to be associated with a significant reduction in implicit biases against that outgroup. We propose that these changes occur via a process of self association that first takes place in the physical, bodily domain as an increase in perceived physical similarity between self and outgroup member. This self association then extends to the conceptual domain, leading to a generalization of positive self-like associations to the outgroup.},

The objective of this study is to examine the existing evidence on the impact of educational gamification on student motivation and academic performance in the last five years in order to analyze its distribution over time, educational level, variables, and most used game elements, and know the advantages of its implementation in the classroom. For this, a systematic review is proposed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology in three multidisciplinary databases, through an exhaustive search with inclusion and exclusion criteria on quantitative experimental studies that explore gamification in educational centers, which provide information about the most current lines of research. Fourteen studies were included in this review. These used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Most of them report gamification as a valid learning strategy. The results support the conclusion that educational gamification has a potential impact on the academic performance, commitment, and motivation of students. Therefore, this study implies the need to expand research on the needs and challenges of students when learning with gamified techniques.},

  abstract = {In the field of education, virtual reality (VR) offers learners an immersive and interactive learning experience, allowing them to comprehend challenging concepts and ideas more efficiently and effectively. VR technology has enabled educators to develop a wide range of learning experiences, from virtual field trips to complex simulations, that may be utilized to engage students and help them learn. Learning theories and approaches are essential for understanding how students learn and how to design effective learning experiences. This study examines the most recent published findings in educational theories and approaches connected to the use of VR systems for educational and tutoring purposes. Seventeen research studies that meet the search criteria have been found in the database, and each of them focuses on at least one learning theory or learning approach related to educational systems using VR. These studies yielded five educational approaches, one methodology, five learning theories and one theoretical framework, which are presented in the context of virtual reality in education. These include constructivism learning, experiential learning, gamification of learning, John Dewey's theory of learning by doing, flow theory, Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, design thinking, learning through problem solving, scientific discovery learning, social constructivism, cognitive load theory and the Technology Pedagogical Content Knowledge Framework (TPACK). A major finding of this study is that constructivism learning is the most often utilized learning theory/method, Experiential Learning is most appropriate for VR and the gamification of learning has the greatest future potential.},

Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5\,years (2010--2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5\,years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i)                 effectiveness                 , (ii)                 acceptance                 , (iii)                 engagement                 and (iv)                 social interactions                 .

  abstract = {The Pisco and wine industry in Chile generates about 400,000 tonnes/year of grape pomace as organic wastes (OWs). This material can be composted and used as organic fertilizer or amendment in grape orchards located in inceptisol soils with a very low organic matter as a strategy to increase soil and grape quality. The maturity and the stabilization of compost define the potential use of OWs as an amendment. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were focused to evaluate the evolution of chemical, microbiological, biochemical and phytotoxicity parameters during the composting process using grape marc and other components. The experimental study consisted of nine opened piles constituted by grape pomace, goat or horse manure. The piles were evaluated for 180 days in winter-spring seasons and mechanical turns were carried out every 10 days. The results indicated that humic to fulvic acids content ratio (Ha/Fa) could be used as process evolution indicator. The potential enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase and {$\beta$}-glucosidase, and microbiological functional groups like cellulolytic, amylolytic and phosphate solubilizing bacteria were strongly correlated with production of fulvic and humic acids (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.01). The compost derived from treatments complies with Chilean National Standard - NCh 2880/04, 2016 for the quality of organic amendments including low phytotoxicity with a radish germination \%{$>$} 92\% and absence of Salmonella sp., and fecal coliforms {$<$}1000 NMP/g. In conclusion, quality parameters evaluated showed sensitivity to evaluate both the composting process and compost quality.},

  abstract = {The use of games in education has become an increasingly present practice in contemporary society. For so-called "digital natives", learning through electronic games becomes more significant. Digital educational games are often seen as boring, non-motivational, that fail to bring in some essential elements that promote engagement, making the learning goal is not achieved either. Game Design is a game project. It describes how the game should be, defining its mechanics and interactions between player and the virtual world of the game and how they can affect the game environment. In order to document the design of a game, there is the Game Design Document (GDD), whose one of the main objectives, besides registration, is to help in communication between the different production teams of a game, allowing the game designer a broad view of that is being produced. However, because it is a large document that brings in detail all the main elements for the production of a game, it turns out to be little used, especially if the focus is the elaboration of small games, which are the majority of the digital educational games that exist. For these short games, which can often be worked out within a few hours, there are Short Game Design Document (SGDD). The SGDD, unlike GDD, will describe the elements of the game in a simplified way possible, whereas the game to be drawn from it is also a simple game. Thus, the proposal of this work is to elaborate a model of SGDD for educational games (the SGDDEdu), specifying elements of art, sound, mechanics and game programming, as well as educational elements in accordance with the new BNCC (National Curricular Common Base) of Elementary School, so that there is a standardization and better categorization of educational games aligned with the proposed pedagogical objectives and the skills and competences described in each level of education. This work will be developed from the study and analysis of some models of already existing SGDD and the BNCC of Elementary School in general, causing in SGDDEdu. The research will be applied with teachers and educators requesting that they specify an educational game in the SGDDEdu template. With this, we intend to verify if the SGDDEdu has relevance and if it facilitates in the production of digital educational games, providing the teaching and learning process through the games, as well as trying to identify how the NCCB can contribute in the development of educational games.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background:               Medical education is rapidly evolving. Students enter medical school with a high level of technological literacy and an expectation for instructional variety in the curriculum. In response, many medical schools now incorporate technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education applications. Education games, medical mobile applications, and virtual patient simulations are together termed               gamified training platforms               .                                         Objective:               To review available literature for the benefits of using gamified training platforms for medical education (both preclinical and clinical) and training. Also, to identify platforms suitable for these purposes with links to multimedia content.                                         Methods:               Peer-reviewed literature, commercially published media, and grey literature were searched to compile an archive of recently published scientific evaluations of gamified training platforms for medical education. Specific educational games, mobile applications, and virtual simulations useful for preclinical and clinical training were identified and categorized. Available evidence was summarized as it related to potential educational advantages of the identified platforms for medical education.                                         Results:               Overall, improved learning outcomes have been demonstrated with virtual patient simulations. Games have the potential to promote learning, increase engagement, allow for real-word application, and enhance collaboration. They can also provide opportunities for risk-free clinical decision making, distance training, learning analytics, and swift feedback. A total of 5 electronic games and 4 mobile applications were identified for preclinical training, and 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools were identified for clinical training. Nine additional gamified, virtual environment training tools not commercially available were also identified.                                         Conclusion:               Many published studies suggest possible benefits from using gamified media in medical curriculum. This is a rapidly growing field. More research is required to rigorously evaluate the specific educational benefits of these interventions. This archive of hyperlinked tools can be used as a resource for all levels of medical trainees, providers, and educators.},

  abstract = {Field learning is considered an essential part of geoscience education, yet there are many practical challenges that limit broad and equitable access to field learning. Virtual field experiences can now help to broaden access to field learning. This work details the learning design and technical components of immersive, interactive virtual field trips (iVFTs). iVFTs take the established idea of a computer-based virtual field trip and add adaptive feedback and richer interactivity, which allow for active and more scientifically authentic learning experiences. By using adaptive learning technology, iVFTs can respond intelligently and automatically to student actions, guiding students through exploration, discovery, and analysis. We present evidence for the effectiveness of iVFTs in achieving learning objectives in both high school and undergraduate settings. Students from both samples showed large and statistically significant gains in content knowledge. Normalized gains on a six-item knowledge survey were .90 and .96, respectively (p {$<$} .001). This result broadly demonstrates the value of our iVFT designs. Follow-up research should rigorously study the effects of adaptive feedback, interactivity, and the other distinctive features of iVFTs on student learning.},

The aim of this research is to explore the benefits of VR technology in education that can engage the learning process using Virtual Reality (VR) in the classroom. Thus, the research objectives are to seek for student design and development of application, convenient, facileness and gratification of VR application in learning process. Using quantitative method, data from questionnaires and evaluations of existing Virtual Reality applications were analyzed in descriptive way to assess the viability of mobile Virtual Reality as a medium for improving learning. The developing process of an VR mobile based application is defined explicitly, and the final graphical student interface of the application is demonstrated to show overall look of the final product that is developed for this project. This includes three types of testing in this project which are performance testing, user acceptance testing and usability testing. Based on the 40 respondents results, it can be concluded that virtual reality application is a good application that can enhance and also engage students learning process in science subject as the mean value for perceived of convenient items was 3.67, followed by 3.66 for perceived of facileness items and finally mean value for perceived of gratification items was 3.61. To conclude, virtual reality application is an effective application for students' science learning process in school especially in the 21st century teaching and learning.},

Here, a novel use for resazurin as an indicator for vitality assessment across several species is proposed. Different amounts of biomass as well as mixtures of live/dead biomass were investigated for their capabilities of metabolizing resazurin and monitored over time. Increasing (live) biomass was found to increase reaction rate in a linear fashion, giving information about the cells' vitality. In an application example, stored suspension cultures of Sporosarcina pasteurii were found to decrease in viability over time, while urease activity decreased as well. For the first time, the assessment of vitality by one technique was demonstrated for several species in parallel.},

In this study we estimate global greenhouse (GHG) emissions due to synthetic N fertiliser manufacture, transportation, and field use in agricultural systems. By developing the largest field-level dataset available on N2O soil emissions we estimate national, regional and global N2O direct emission factors (EFs), while we retrieve from the literature the EFs for indirect N2O soil emissions, and for N fertiliser manufacturing and transportation. We find that the synthetic N fertiliser supply chain was responsible for estimated emissions of 1.13 GtCO2e in 2018, representing 10.6\% of agricultural emissions and 2.1\% of global GHG emissions. Synthetic N fertiliser production accounted for 38.8\% of total synthetic N fertiliser-associated emissions, while field emissions accounted for 58.6\% and transportation accounted for the remaining 2.6\%. The top four emitters together, China, India, USA and EU28 accounted for 62\% of the total. Historical trends reveal the great disparity in total and per capita N use in regional food production. Reducing overall production and use of synthetic N fertilisers offers large mitigation potential and in many cases realisable potential to reduce emissions.},

  abstract = {Although error avoidance during learning appears to be the rule in American classrooms, laboratory studies suggest that it may be a counterproductive strategy, at least for neurologically typical students. Experimental investigations indicate that errorful learning followed by corrective feedback is beneficial to learning. Interestingly, the beneficial effects are particularly salient when individuals strongly believe that their error is correct: Errors committed with high confidence are corrected more readily than low-confidence errors. Corrective feedback, including analysis of the reasoning leading up to the mistake, is crucial. Aside from the direct benefit to learners, teachers gain valuable information from errors, and error tolerance encourages students' active, exploratory, generative engagement. If the goal is optimal performance in high-stakes situations, it may be worthwhile to allow and even encourage students to commit and correct errors while they are in low-stakes learning situations rather...},

  abstract = {This study is a ten-year critical review of empirical research on the educational applications of Virtual Reality (VR). Results show that although the majority of the 53 reviewed articles refer to science and mathematics, researchers from social sciences also seem to appreciate the educational value of VR and incorporate their learning goals in Educational Virtual Environments (EVEs). Although VR supports multisensory interaction channels, visual representations predominate. Few are the studies that incorporate intuitive interactivity, indicating a research trend in this direction. Few are the settings that use immersive EVEs reporting positive results on users' attitudes and learning outcomes, indicating that there is a need for further research on the capabilities of such systems. Features of VR that contribute to learning such as first order experiences, natural semantics, size, transduction, reification, autonomy and presence are exploited according to the educational context and content. Presence seems to play an important role in learning and it is a subject needing further and intensive studies. Constructivism seems to be the theoretical model the majority of the EVEs are based on. The studies present real world, authentic tasks that enable context and content dependent knowledge construction. They also provide multiple representations of reality by representing the natural complexity of the world. Findings show that collaboration and social negotiation are not only limited to the participants of an EVE, but exist between participants and avatars, offering a new dimension to computer assisted learning. Little can yet be concluded regarding the retention of the knowledge acquired in EVEs. Longitudinal studies are necessary, and we believe that the main outcome of this study is the future research perspectives it brings to light.},

This raises questions like: How is information represented? How is it stored? How is it retrieved? Then, how is it used? This paper tries to deal with all these at once. When you get an idea and want to ``remember'' it, you create a ``K-line'' for it. When later activated, the K-line induces a partial mental state resembling the one that created it. A ``partial mental state'' is a subset of those mental agencies operating at one moment. This view leads to many ideas about the development, structure and physiology of memory, and about how to implement framelike representations in a distributed processor.},

  abstract = {In the current education system, we expect the comprehension level of all the students in a classroom to be same. However, this is not the case. There are many factors that may affect the comprehension of lectures in the classroom including class size, visibility of the whiteboard, student's level of concentration, student's level of comprehension to name a few. Our main aim is to find a better way to offer the best education experience for students using the latest innovative solutions in technology. During our survey of Virtual Reality (VR) applications, we identified several readily available applications most of which were related to either medical education, tourism or other domains of sciences. None of the applications were available for general education where a complete classroom is transported into virtual reality. In this paper, we developed a VR framework that enhances the learning experience of students who face difficulties in the classroom. Moreover, we developed a complete prototype system to validate the framework. The proposed framework makes learning immersive, interactive and narrative offering enhanced motivation to students. The prototype system setup involves setting up a camera in the classroom to capture the whiteboard. Visuals from the whiteboard augmented with the course material (lecture slides) are compiled together to create a virtual space for the students. Students can interact with the virtual classroom by a provided set of tools in the virtual space. The VR application is developed using Unity 3D Engine and interaction is implemented using a handheld Bluetooth device.},

  abstract = {Level sets have been established as highly versatile implicit surface representations, with widespread use in graphics applications including modeling and dynamic simulation. Nevertheless, level sets are often presumed to be limited, compared to explicit meshes, in their ability to represent domains with thin topological features (e.g. narrow slits and gaps) or, even worse, material overlap. Geometries with such features may arise from modeling tools that tolerate occasional self-intersections, fracture modeling algorithms that create narrow or zero-width cuts by design, or as transient states in collision processing pipelines for deformable objects. Converting such models to level sets can alter their topology if thin features are not resolved by the grid size. We argue that this ostensible limitation is not an inherent defect of the implicit surface concept, but a collateral consequence of the standard Cartesian lattice used to store the level set values. We propose storing signed distance values on a regular hexahedral mesh which can have multiple collocated cubic elements and non-manifold bifurcation to accommodate non-trivial topology. We show how such non-manifold level sets can be systematically generated from convenient alternative geometric representations. Finally we demonstrate how this representation can facilitate fast and robust treatment of self-collision in simulations of volumetric elastic deformable bodies.},

Whereas fluorescence in situ hybridization allows single mRNA imaging in fixed cells, the MS2-GFP labeling technique enables the observation of mRNA dynamics in living cells. Recently, two genetically engineered mouse models have been developed for the application of the MS2-GFP system in live animals. First, the Actb-MBS mouse was generated by knocking in 24 repeats of the MS2 stem-loop sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the {$\beta$}-actin gene. Second, the MCP mouse was made to express the NLS-HA-MCP-GFP transgene in all cell types. By crossing Actb-MBS and MCP mice, a double homozygous mouse line, MCP{\texttimes}MBS, was established to visualize endogenous {$\beta$}-actin mRNA labeled with multiple green fluorescent proteins. By imaging hippocampal neurons or brain slices from MCP{\texttimes}MBS mice, the dynamics of mRNA, such as transcription, transport, and localization, can be studied at single mRNA resolution. In this chapter, we explain the basics of MCP{\texttimes}MBS mice and describe methods for utilizing these animals.},

  abstract = {Resolving human--wildlife conflicts requires the assessment and implementation of appropriate technical measures that minimize negative impacts on socio-economic uses, including agriculture, and ensure the adequate protection of biological diversity. Rice paddies are widely distributed in the western Mediterranean region. Because of their high productivity, they can be a good habitat for waterbirds, including the purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, particularly in areas where natural wetlands have been removed or reduced. As a result of its population growth, there have been increasing levels of damage caused by this species in rice fields due to stem-cutting and opening of bald patches in rice fields. With the aim of reducing damage, we evaluated the effectiveness of passive and active measures that would limit access to rice fields and deter/scare away purple swamphens in affected areas of the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We selected the techniques according to the growth phase of rice and the activity of birds in the rice fields (perimeter fences and clearing vegetation around the rice plots during sprouting and growing phases, and falconry at maturation). There were positive results during the sprouting and growing phases thanks to fences and clearing vegetation, reducing the affected area by 37.8\% between treatment and control plots. This would mean an economic savings of 18,550 {\texteuro}/year in compensation payments by regional administrations including the investment in implementing and maintaining passive protection measures. Active deterrence through falconry did not reduce the level of damage. The analysis of purple swamphen home range, activity centers (centroids), and the proportion of locations in and outside of rice fields showed no differences before and after dissuasive practices. These results were influenced by multiple concurrent factors including weather, the structural configuration of the rice plots and their location. In summary, we recommend the establishment of protection measures (perimeter fences + clearing vegetation around the rice plots) to reduce the level of damage.},

ATCC 33047 released, during the stationary growth phase in batch culture and, at low dilution rate, in continuous culture, large amounts of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) to the culture medium. Different environmental, nutritional and physical parameters affected production and accumulation of the EPS. The presence of either a combined nitrogen source or NaCl at high concentration led to decreased EPS production, without affecting cell growth. In contrast, generation of the EPS was markedly enhanced in response to an increase in either air flow rate, temperature or irradiance. In continuous culture, accumulation of EPS in the medium increased in response to a decrease in the dilution rate, with maximal EPS productivity being reached at a dilution rate of 0.03 h-1.},

Methods               An experimental study theoretically substantiates the prospects for the gamification of education on the example of history education, in which 40 students from the {\cyrchar\CYRR}eoples' Friendship University of Russia and Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University took part. A pedagogical model of gamified history study has been developed and implemented into a 3-month online learning course ``Technology for constructing historical interpretations.'' The following technological tools were used to support the implementation of gamified learning: the Academy Learning Management System (LMS), the Facebook social network, social media information resources, augmented and virtual reality technologies. A survey was conducted on the Academy LMS platform, in which students were asked to assess the promising opportunities for the impact of gamified learning on the development of key professional competencies in terms of the degree of influence.                                         Results               The research results confirmed that the creation of a joint creative and expanded gaming experience leads to the acquisition of practical knowledge and allows learners to acquire skills that are highly relevant for professionals of the 21st century. The students confirmed that educational progress was achieved due to the effective organization of their learning activities, group changeover at the stages of developing historical interpretations, and gamification, which caused a feeling of excitement and qualitatively influenced the desire to achieve the best educational results. Gamified learning allowed educators to keep students' interest in the subject of study.                                         Conclusions               According to the results of a survey of students at the end of the course, it was concluded that gamification in history education has a positive effect on the evolutionary development of a personality adaptive to the socio-economic conditions of the 21st century. A model of the evolutionary vertical and horizontal development of the personality has been described.},

From 2011 to 2013, its breeding ecology was studied at two natural wetlands in north-east Algeria, namely Garaet Hadj Tahar and Garaet Messaoussa. Numbers of Purple Swamphens at both localities peaked in late April and early May. Egg-laying started in early March, whereas hatching started in late March. Peak egg-laying took place in late March and early April, and peak hatching from mid-April to early May. There were significant differences in the size and weight of eggs between years and localities. The mean clutch size was 2.75 {\textpm} 0.70 eggs and it was not signifi- cantly different between localities and years. Mean hatching success was 51\% and it was positively correlated to nest depth only at Garaet Hadj Tahar. Most nests were built in dense tufts of Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis. The main nesting materials were Phragmites australis and Scirpus maritimus.},

  abstract = {Ophthalmology is a medical profession with a tradition in teaching that has developed throughout history. Although ophthalmologists are generally considered to only prescribe contact lenses, and they handle more than half of eye-related enhancements, diagnoses, and treatments. The training of qualified ophthalmologists is generally carried out under the traditional settings, where there is a supervisor and a student, and training is based on the use of animal eyes or artificial eye models. These models have significant disadvantages, as they are not immersive and are extremely expensive and difficult to acquire. Therefore, technologies related to Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are rapidly and prominently positioning themselves in the medical sector, and the field of ophthalmology is growing exponentially both in terms of the training of professionals and in the assistance and recovery of patients. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight and analyze the developments that have made use of game technologies for the teaching of ophthalmology and the results that have been obtained. This systematic review aims to investigate software and hardware applications developed exclusively for educational environments related to ophthalmology and provide an analysis of other related tools. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages, limitations, and challenges involved in the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and game technologies in this field are also presented.},

  abstract = {Applied research involves interactions between different organisations---academia, industry, government. Breakdowns in communication can occur during these interactions which alter a project's outcome. We omit how we encounter and overcome these problems from scientific manuscripts which mask the social and cultural considerations that are critical to a project's success. Autoethnography is a form of structured reflection whereby researchers use personal experience to contribute to understanding collaborative processes. We propose an applied form of autoethnography as a repeatable protocol to describe inter-organisational interactions during the research process in ecology and environmental research. We demonstrate the use of this protocol with five case studies from a diversity of wildlife research across a wide variety of experience levels and scales from small mammals, large herbivores and predators to digital ecology. Our applied autoethnography protocol would ensure that specific biases and context are adequately described and that problems encountered and lessons learned from the experience are reflected upon. These reports can be presented as stand-alone publications where appropriate, that is, to communicate an effective solution for a novel problem, or within the methods or supplementary material of manuscripts to further explain how the project developed from initial idea to final publication. Furthermore, this protocol can be used by practitioners to evaluate the trajectory of management decisions and policy implications in their jurisdiction to promote transparency and improve communication with stakeholders. Synthesis and Applications: Applied science will continue to intersect with organisations that help or hinder research efforts depending on cultural contexts and biases. Using adequate reflection on case studies to record these experiences and disseminate lessons to the wider community will improve how we approach problems in research, help us to avoid repeating mistakes and ultimately save time and resources. Outside of research, case studies derived from this protocol allow practitioners to holistically understand the methods, biases and challenges of the research from a new perspective, thus providing a novel knowledge brokering function between academia and practitioners in applied ecology.},

It is customary that growers apply high doses of nutrients to the soil in order to achieve high yields, with detrimental consequences for the environment; but no information exists with regards to the crop response to high fertilization levels. High dosages of chemical fertilizer deteriorate the fertile lands and hurts beneficial soil microorganisms. Overfertilization creates havoc through environmental, health and economic losses to the farmers particularly in the developing countries. Countries usually recommend chemical fertilizers to feed the ever increasing world's population. However, proper fertilizer management techniques are necessary to lessen the adverse impact of chemical fertilizer. The current chapter finds that there is a need for proper fertilizer guidelines to support sustainable agriculture practice worldwide. The current chapters is the attempt to overview the productivity losses to crops due to high usage of chemical fertilizer particularly in last decade. Thus chapter also shed a light on management strategies of chemical fertilizer that ensure sustainable crop production.},

  abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO), a major constituent of NOx in fossil fuel flue gas, can be removed by the microalga, Dunaliella tertiolecta, in a bubble-column-type bioreactor. The uptake pathway of NO was investigated, and it was found that little NO was oxidized in the medium before its uptake by algal cells and that NO mostly permeated directly into the cells by diffusion based on the mass balance of nitrogen and the change in nitrate and nitrite concentration in the medium in batch culture. For further application of this system, it is necessary to remove NO over a long duration, and the stability of NO removal is important. NO removal rate of about 50--60\% could be maintained stably for 15 days in continuous culture under the light condition. Because the consumption of nitrate was reduced by the amount of taken NO, NO rather than nitrate is preferentially utilized as a nitrogen source for cell growth. Therefore, this algal system is useful for continuous NO removal and production of algal biomass using NO as a nitrogen source.},

Some important species can strongly shape community structure and ecosystem functioning, but their impacts and interactions on ecosystem-level responses to disturbance are less well known. Shallow ponds provide a model system in which to study the effects of such species because some taxa mitigate transitions between alternative ecosystem states caused by eutrophication. We performed pond experiments to test how two foundation species (a macrophyte and a mussel) affected the biomass of planktonic primary producers and its stability in response to nutrient additions. Individually, each species reduced phytoplankton biomass and tended to increase rates of recovery from disturbance, but together the species reversed these effects, particularly with larger nutrient additions. This reversal was mediated by high cyanobacterial dominance of the community and a resulting loss of trait evenness. Effects of the foundation species on primary producer biomass were associated with effects on other ecosystem properties, including turbidity and dissolved oxygen. Our work highlights the important role of foundation species and their interactive effects in determining responses of ecosystem functioning to disturbance.},

Success relies on understanding coupled nitrogen and carbon metabolism in soils, their associated influences on soil structure and the processes controlling nitrogen transformations at scales relevant to microbial activity. Here we show that the influence of organic matter on arable soil nitrogen transformations can be decoded by integrating metagenomic data with soil structural parameters. Our approach provides a mechanistic explanation of why organic matter is effective in reducing nitrous oxide losses while supporting system resilience. The relationship between organic carbon, soil-connected porosity and flow rates at scales relevant to microbes suggests that important increases in nutrient-use efficiency could be achieved at lower organic carbon stocks than currently envisaged.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               The last decade has seen many changes in graduate medical education training in the USA, most notably the implementation of duty hour standards for residents by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education. As educators are left to balance more limited time available between patient care and resident education, new methods to augment traditional graduate medical education are needed.                                         Objectives               To assess acceptance and use of a novel gamification-based medical knowledge software among internal medicine residents and to determine retention of information presented to participants by this medical knowledge software.                                         Methods               We designed and developed software using principles of gamification to deliver a web-based medical knowledge competition among internal medicine residents at the University of Alabama (UA) at Birmingham and UA at Huntsville in 2012--2013. Residents participated individually and in teams. Participants accessed daily questions and tracked their online leaderboard competition scores through any internet-enabled device. We completed focus groups to assess participant acceptance and analysed software use, retention of knowledge and factors associated with loss of participants (attrition).                                         Results               Acceptance: In focus groups, residents (n=17) reported leaderboards were the most important motivator of participation. Use: 16\>427 questions were completed: 28.8\% on Saturdays/Sundays, 53.1\% between 17:00 and 08:00. Retention of knowledge: 1046 paired responses (for repeated questions) were collected. Correct responses increased by 11.9\% (p\&lt;0.0001) on retest. Differences per time since question introduction, trainee level and style of play were observed. Attrition: In ordinal regression analyses, completing more questions (0.80 per 10\% increase; 0.70 to 0.93) decreased, while postgraduate year 3 class (4.25; 1.44 to 12.55) and non-daily play (4.51; 1.50 to 13.58) increased odds of attrition.                                         Conclusions               Our software-enabled, gamification-based educational intervention was well accepted among our millennial learners. Coupling software with gamification and analysis of trainee use and engagement data can be used to develop strategies to augment learning in time-constrained educational settings.},

  abstract = {Carbon-nitrogen coupling is a fundamental principle in ecosystem ecology. However, how the coupling responds to global change has not yet been examined. Through a comprehensive and systematic literature review, we assessed how the dynamics of carbon processes change with increasing nitrogen input and how nitrogen processes change with increasing carbon input under global change. Our review shows that nitrogen input to the ecosystem mostly stimulates plant primary productivity but inconsistently decreases microbial activities or increases soil carbon sequestration, with nitrogen leaching and nitrogenous gas emission rapidly increasing. Nitrogen fixation increases and nitrogen leaching decreases to improve soil nitrogen availability and support plant growth and ecosystem carbon sequestration under elevated CO2 and temperature or along ecosystem succession. We conclude that soil nitrogen cycle processes continually adjust to change in response to either overload under nitrogen addition or deficiency under CO2 enrichment and ecosystem succession to couple with carbon cycling. Indeed, processes of both carbon and nitrogen cycles continually adjust under global change, leading to dynamic coupling in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The dynamic coupling framework reconciles previous debates on the ``uncoupling'' or ``decoupling'' of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycles under global change. Ecosystem models failing to simulate these dynamic adjustments cannot simulate carbon-nitrogen coupling nor predict ecosystem carbon sequestration well.},

Major uncertainties in existing approaches for quantifying flow resistance and longitudinal dispersion at the reach scale arise from limitations in the characterization of riverbed roughness. In this study, we characterized the riverbed roughness in small moderate-gradient streams (0.1--0.5\% bed slope) and investigated its effects on flow resistance and dispersion. We analyzed highresolution transect-based measurements of stream depth and width, which resolved the complete roughness spectrum with scales ranging from the micro to the reach scale. Independently measured flow resistance and dispersion coefficients were mainly affected by roughness at spatial scales between the median grain size and the stream width, i.e., by roughness between the micro- and the mesoscale. We also compared our flow resistance measurements with calculations using various flow resistance equations. Flow resistance in our study streams was well approximated by the equations that were developed for high gradient streams ({$>$}1\%) and it was overestimated by approaches developed for sand-bed streams with a smooth riverbed or ripple bed.},

This enzyme uses a unique transition-metal--sulfur--carbon cluster as its active-site co-factor ([(R-homocitrate)MoFe7S9C], FeMoco)1,2, and the sulfur-surrounded iron (Fe) atoms have been postulated to capture and reduce N2 (refs. 3--6). Although there are a few examples of synthetic counterparts of the FeMoco, metal--sulfur cluster, which have shown binding of N2 (refs. 7--9), the reduction of N2 by any synthetic metal--sulfur cluster or by the extracted form of FeMoco10 has remained elusive, despite nearly 50\,years of research. Here we show that the Fe atoms in our synthetic [Mo3S4Fe] cubes11,12 can capture a N2 molecule and catalyse N2 silylation to form N(SiMe3)3 under treatment with excess sodium and trimethylsilyl chloride. These results exemplify the catalytic silylation of N2 by a synthetic metal--sulfur cluster and demonstrate the N2-reduction capability of Fe atoms in a sulfur-rich environment, which is reminiscent of the ability of FeMoco to bind and activate N2.},

These residues should be addressed for recycling or treatment before being returned to environment. As each winery is unique in waste generation and disposal, plans for environmentally friendly waste management are not universal and should be tested for their effectiveness. In this study, a diagnostic was made during three years, in different wineries, throughout Portugal, in order to quantify and characterize the waste and the wastewater produced. The results showed that solid waste and wastewater are mainly produced during the harvest period, corresponding to 74\% and 87\%, respectively. One ton of processed grape approximately produce 0.13 t marc, 0.06 t lees, 0.03 t of stalks and 1.65 m3 of wastewater. No significant differences (P{$\leq$}0.05) were observed for grape marc, lees and wastewater ratios, between years or wineries. With respect to the stalk ratio, there was no effect of year but the winery significantly affected this ratio (P{$\leq$}0.05). During the study period the treated wastewater, since diluted, revealed suitable characteristics for irrigation representing an additional source of water. In this regard, the data acquisition and consolidation ensure the transfer of information and experience which constitute an essential step in a support decision tool design.},

There are many established processes for software development that can improve and streamline development, and incorporating the best practices from educational pedagogy and software development may enhance teamwork and communication, decrease development costs, and improve the quality of serious games.

A number of frameworks have come into popular practice and while there exists a "common sense" understanding of what a framework in game design might be, there are limited attempts to formally add to their definition through discourse. This paper seeks to address problems that may have led to this gap in our knowledge about frameworks. We also outline a selection of frameworks that we believe to be of use for developers, and present the questions that arose from early attempts to define and compare these frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other papers that attempt to address these basic concerns regarding frameworks in game design, and only two other surveys of some of the various frameworks available. Through our discussion and conclusion, we propose that further research should be done in the interests of finding an appropriate measure for comparing frameworks, as well as suggest potential methodologies to use. We stress the value of a process of discussion regarding frameworks, over the output of a strict definition. It is our hope that readers will find this paper a thought-provoking and useful resource for their own research and practice.},

Scholars and practitioners in the field of education call for innovative ways of engaging youth---a reason why gamification has gained more attention in recent years. This paper aims at exploring the role of gamification in affecting pro-environmental behavioral change and searching for best practices for educational purposes. For that aim, pro-environmental gamification platforms are identified and analyzed by applying two different frameworks: the Octalysis Framework and the Climate Change Engagement through Games Framework. After scanning 181 cases, a final sample of six is analyzed and two of them are selected as best practices with higher potential to engage users in pro-environmental behavioral change: SaveOhno and JouleBug. Meaning, ownership, and social influence, as well as achievability, challenge, and credibility, are seen as core elements that can increase the success of gamification platforms. In conclusion, the more attributes are enclosed in the gamification design, the stronger physical and mental connections it builds up with participants. Insights from this study can help educators to select best practices and gamification designers to better influence behavioral change through game mechanics.},

This study used the virtual reality (VR) technology to develop a virtual ecological environment for learning about the Taipei tree frog, supported by situated learning and game-based learning design to enhance students' learning interest and motivation. Users can wear the head-mounted display (HMD) to explore the virtual environment for learning the Taipei tree frog's ecological behavior, such as foraging and mating as well as its habitats and predators. A teaching experiment was conducted to investigate students' learning effectiveness and the senses of presence and anxiety after using the virtual ecological environment. The experimental group (wearing the HMD) contained 40 students, the control group (using the desktop VR) contained 40 students, and both groups were used as samples to learn about the Taipei tree frog. The results indicated that using HMD VR and desktop VR could both enhance learning achievements, but the learning effectiveness of the former was significantly higher than that of the latter. The levels of anxiety for both groups were about the same, but the level of presence for the experimental group was higher than that of the control group because the HMD VR provided a more immersive experience than the desktop VR. The virtual ecological environment can save the time and effort of travelling to the natural habitat for observing the Taipei tree frog, and the design of role-playing game (RPG) can enhance learners' interest and motivation. Therefore, it is a useful tool for promoting environmental education.},

The population suffered severe decline and range contraction at the end of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, due mainly to habitat loss and degradation and excessive hunting. However, the population has begun to recover in the last decade mainly through direct protection of the species and of the remaining habitat, together with creation of artificial wetlands and a reintroduction programme, and probably also due to immigration from Spain. The population size has increased about 10-fold and the range has expanded to most of its former area. The estimated Portuguese breeding population in 2002 was 49--67 pairs. Densities varied between 0.05 and 7 individuals/ha in recently colonized areas and stable (saturated) areas, respectively. Although the population is recovering, its small size, high fragmentation and several natural and anthropogenic threats lead us to consider it still a species of major concern in Portugal.},

  abstract = {EN) Agri-environment measures are a key element for the integration of environmental concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy. They are designed to encourage farmers to protect and enhance the environment on their farmland by paying them for the provision of environmental services. Rural Development Programme 2014 -- 2020 introduced an agrienvironmental measure for multifunctional field margins (biostrips on arable land), which contributes to increasing biodiversity, to protection of basic environmental elements and it also serves as prevention for climate change. Since so far no farmer asked the Agricultural Paying Agency for commitment, the objective of the paper was to assess the design and accuracy of calculation of the agri-environmental and climatic measure - the multifunctional field margins in the conditions of Slovakia. The research results show that the calculation methodology is incorrectly set and it does not compensate for the farmer's loss on farm yields.},

  abstract = {Our main goal was to investigate if and how using multiple immersive virtual reality (iVR) simulations and their video playback, in a science course, affects student learning over time. We conducted a longitudinal study, in ecological settings, at an undergraduate field-course on three topics in environmental biology. Twenty-eight undergraduates were randomly assigned to either an iVR-interaction group or a video-viewing group. During the field-course, the iVR group interacted with a head-mounted device-based iVR simulation related to each topic (i.e. total three interventions), while the video group watched a pre-recorded video of the respective simulation on a laptop. Cognitive and affective data were collected through the following checkpoints: a pre-test before the first intervention, one topic-specific post-test immediately after each intervention, a final post-test towards the end of the course, and a longitudinal post-test deployed approximately 2 months after the course. Through a descriptive analysis, it was found that student performance on the knowledge tests increased considerably over time for the iVR group but remained unchanged for the video group. While no within- or between-group differences were noted for intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy measures, students in the iVR group enjoyed all the simulations, and perceived themselves to benefit from those simulations.},

My contention is that in many cases, researchers are not actually conducting ethnography as understood within a traditional sense but rather are engaging in case study, drawing on ethnographic techniques. Does that matter you might ask? Well it determines what we can expect to discover from a research project in terms of results and the unearthing of deeper complexities. I frame the discussion around a set of closely related issues, namely: ethnography, case study and researcher positioning, drawing on ethnographic techniques and fieldwork relations. The original contribution of the piece and overall argument is that research can represent a hybrid form, and based on my own research experience, I propose a new term `ethno -case study' that has advantages of both ethnography and case study.},

VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.},

This suggests that the conversion of multimedia lessons into virtual reality may not yet be warranted. However, because increasing student interest and motivation may be a critical factor in classrooms, it is worthwhile to examine what supplemental learning strategies could be added to a medium that students enjoy. Experiment 2 showed that asking students to summarize segments of the immersive virtual reality lesson increased their learning outcomes without diminishing their motivation and interest. Taken together, the 2 experiments showed that students' interest can be primed with new and exciting technology while still being an effective medium to convey scientific information comparable to traditional PowerPoint slideshow lessons.},

The paucity of resources and lack of knowledges to manage the pandemic, coupled with the fear of future consequences has established the need for adoption of emerging and future technologies to address the upcoming challenges. With introduction of measures to control the pandemic, trainees will see a dramatic decline in their in-person exposure to all aspects of their education, with no clear endpoint. This presents an extreme challenge for educators and, given the rapidly evolving situation, there have not yet been training authorities recommendations.

Schemes including the reuse of urban wastewater represent improvements on the overall energy balance, but will not allow for significant production of biofuels unless the nitrogen from the non-TAG portions of microalgae is recycled. Approaches to recycling nitrogen require an improved understanding of the tradeoffs between the different potential uses of the non-TAG microalgal portion (i.e., energy production via anaerobic digestion or thermal catalytic processes), and the development of nitrogen separation technologies.},

  abstract = {There is a significant body of research relating to augmented reality (AR) uses for learning in the primary and the secondary education sectors across the globe. However, there is not such a substantial amount of work exploring the combination of AR with game-based learning (ARGBL). Although ARGBL has the potential to enable new forms of teaching and transform the learning experience, it remains unclear how ARGBL applications can impact students' motivation, achievements, and learning performance. This study reports a systematic review of the literature on ARGBL approaches in compulsory education considering the advantages, disadvantages, instructional affordances, and/or effectiveness of ARGBL across various primary and secondary education subjects. In total, 21 studies published between 2012 and 2017 in 11 indexed journals were analysed, with 14 studies focusing on primary education and 7 on secondary. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art research in ARGBL in compulsory education. Trends and the vision towards the future are also discussed, as ARGBL can potentially influence the students' attendance, knowledge transfer, skill acquisition, hands-on digital experience, and positive attitude towards their learning. This review aims to lay the groundwork for educators, technology developers, and other stakeholders involved in the development of literacy programmes for young children by offering new insights with effective advice and suggestions on how to increase student motivation and improve learning outcomes and the learning experience by incorporating ARGBL into their teaching.},

Games are an increasingly important component of our learning ecologies but their potential can prove difficult to fully harness due to the downsides of gaming in informal contexts and to the limitations games can present when adopted in formal learning contexts. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of games for learning, and to gather stakeholder recommendations for the main actors in the field. The adopted research approach is qualitative and participatory, involving players, teachers, parents, researchers and developers. Data from 25 interviews and 11 focus groups yielded insights into the educational, psychological and ethical aspects of play. Results suggest that gameplay influences individuals in a very personal manner, and that its effects cover a wide range of skills, extending to identity development. Hence, to harness this potential, all actors in the ecology need strong awareness of both the affordances and the risks of games, and deep respect for individuals' LEs. The study has implications for a wide range of actors, including educators, players, researchers, parents, game developers and policymakers.},

With the growth and dissemination of this technology, there is a massive opportunity for teachers to add this technology to their methods of teaching a second/foreign language, since students keep showing a growing interest in new technologies. This systematic review of empirical research aims at understanding whether the use of gaming strategies in virtual reality is beneficial for the learning of a second/foreign language or not. Results show that more than half of the articles proved that virtual reality technologies with gaming strategies can be used to learn a foreign language. It was also found that ``learning'' was the most evaluated dependent variable among the chosen records, augmented reality was the leading technology used, primary education and lower secondary was the most researched school stages, and the most used language to evaluate the use of gamified technology was by far the English language. Given the lack of directed investigation, it is recommended to use these technologies to support second language learning and not entirely replace traditional approaches. A research agenda is also proposed by the authors.},

Virtual reality applications offer a promising way to engage and immerse students in three-dimensional environments and to keep them focused on the learning task. In this paper, we explore interactive virtual reality experiences implemented with HTC Vive as an alternative form of learning tool supporting engagement and to support the ability to concentrate better on the learning tasks. We ran a two-fold user study in which 19 students evaluated the experience looking at engagement, motivation, usability, and learning. First results indicate that such experiences are well suited as a supplement to traditional in-class learning and that they support realistic laboratory setups and simulations in an engaging, interesting, and immersive way and help students to focus more on the learning task compared to traditional applications.},

Current research suggests that climate change may pose a substantial threat to NVP, but the extent to which this will affect the associated ecosystem functions and services is highly uncertain. Here, we propose a research agenda to address this urgent question, focusing on physiological and ecological processes that link NVP to ecosystem functions while also taking into account the substantial taxonomic diversity across multiple ecosystem types. Accordingly, we developed a new categorization scheme, based on microclimatic gradients, which simplifies the high physiological and morphological diversity of NVP and world-wide distribution with respect to several broad habitat types. We found that habitat-specific ecosystem functions of NVP will likely be substantially affected by climate change, and more quantitative process understanding is required on: (1) potential for acclimation; (2) response to elevated CO2; (3) role of the microbiome; and (4) feedback to (micro)climate. We suggest an integrative approach of innovative, multimethod laboratory and field experiments and ecophysiological modelling, for which sustained scientific collaboration on NVP research will be essential.},

The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of a gamified experience through virtual and face-to-face escape rooms as well as to determine the generated levels of fun, absorption, creative thinking, mastery, activation, absence of negative effects and student grades. A descriptive and correlational experimental design has been used. In total, 105 Spanish university students participated. The data was collected using a scale validated in the Spanish context called Gameful Experience in Gamification (GAMEX). The results reveal significant variability according to the training environment. In face-to-face environments, students' fun and activation were promoted, generating pleasant entertainment experiences. In virtual environments, influence, autonomy, creativity, and exploration by students increased. Similarly, these environments shared high levels of spatio-temporal absorption and an absence of negative effects. Regarding the ratings, no statistically significant results that confirm their effectiveness depending on the environment were determined, but good scores were obtained.

  abstract = {A research project was commissioned to investigate the performance of Moringa oleifera compared with that of aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3) and ferric sulphate (Fe2(SO4)3), termed alum and ferric respectively. A series of jar tests was undertaken using model water, different raw water sources and hybrid water containing a mixture of both of these types of water. The model water consisted of deionised water spiked with Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 104 per 100 ml and turbidity (146 NTU) artificially created by kaolin. Results showed that M. oleifera removed 84\% turbidity and 88\% E. coli, whereas alum removed greater than 99\% turbidity and E. coli. Low turbidity river water ({$<$}5 NTU), with an E. coli count of 605 colony forming units (cfu)/100 ml was treated with M. oleifera and ferric. Results showed an 82\% and 94\% reduction in E. coli for M. oleifera and ferric respectively. Tests on turbid river water of 45 NTU, with an E. coli count of 2650 cfu/100 ml, showed a removal of turbidity of 76\% and E. coli reduction of 93\% with M. oleifera. The equivalent reductions for alum were 91\% and 98\% respectively. Highly coloured reservoir water was also spiked with E. coli (104 cfu/100 ml) and turbidity (160 NTU) artificially created by kaolin; termed hybrid water. Under these conditions M. oleifera removed 83\% colour, 97\% turbidity and reduced E. coli by 66\%. Corresponding removal values for alum were 88\% colour, 99\% turbidity and 89\% E. coli, and for ferric were 93\% colour, 98\% turbidity and 86\% E. coli. Tests on model water, using a secondary treatment stage sand filter showed maximum turbidity removal of 97\% and maximum E. coli reduction of 98\% using M. oleifera, compared with 100\% turbidity and 97\% E. coli for alum. Although not as effective as alum or ferric, M. oleifera showed sufficient removal capability to encourage its use for treatment of turbid waters in developing countries.},

Among the available techniques for NOx removal, microalgae-based biological removal of NOx (BioDeNOx) is a promising and competent technology with eco-friendly path of low energy and low-cost solution for the pollution. In this review article, current biological technologies including bacteria-based and microalgae-related BioDeNOx are discussed. Comparing to direct BioDeNOx approach, indirect BioDeNOx by microalgae is more promising since it is more stable, reliable and efficient. By transforming inorganic nitrogen nutrients to organic nitrogen, microalgae can potentially play an important role in converting NOx into high-value added products. The microalgae-based BioDeNOx process displays an attractive prospect for flue gas treatment to reduce environmental NOx pollution and potentially supply protein products, establishing an efficient circular-economy strategy.},

  abstract = {Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere---for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.},

The year in which the most citations of this type occurred was 2009, in which 1913 citations were recorded, whereas 2019 was the most productive year, as 127 documents on this subject were published in that year. The data analysis revealed that all the top ten researchers belong to Australia. Further, the top three researchers (Gregory S., Lee, M.J.W., and Wood, D.), countries (United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia), organizations (Charles Sturt University, Queensland University of Technology, and University of New England, Australia), journals (Computers and Education, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, and Journal of Surgical Education) and collaborations (Australia and New Zealand, United States and the United Kingdom, and Australia and the United Kingdom) belong to developed countries. Virtual reality, virtual worlds, augmented reality, e-learning, and simulations are the top keywords used in the VR domain. The thematic evolution of the keyword shows the importance of ``Virtual Reality'' as a keyword throughout the 27 years of its existence (1994--2020). Furthermore, the main finding of the study is the interdisciplinary nature of the VR domain, which extends from the field of computer sciences to other disciplines.},

Inspired by prior research and qualitative insights from XR professionals, we discuss the meaning and definitions of various terms and organize them in our proposed framework. As a result, we conclude that (1) XR should not be used to connote extended reality, but as a more open approach where the X implies the unknown variable: xReality; (2) AR and VR have fundamental differences and thus should be treated as different experiences; (3) AR experiences can be described on a continuum ranging from assisted reality to mixed reality (based on the level of local presence); and (4), VR experiences can be conceptualized on a telepresence-continuum ranging from atomistic to holistic VR.},

We show that experiments using large and small floating chambers in flowing water over a moderate range of water velocities (0.13--0.23 m s-1) in a laboratory flume resulted in similar k600s to published field measurements with similar water velocities. We confirmed the flume experiments with paired stirred-still beaker experiments, where resulting k600s fell within the extrapolated trend of the flume experiments. We propose that the floating chambers can provide good estimates of CO2 degassing, particularly in shallow, low-velocity, morphologically complex headwater streams, permitting quantification of this important contributor to the global carbon cycle.},

On time scales of decades to centuries, riverine fluxes of HCO23 to the oceans and subsequent reactions affect atmospheric CO2, global climate and ocean pH. This review summarizes controls on the production of HCO23 from chemical weathering and its transport into river systems. The availability of minerals and weathering agents (carbonic, sulfuric, and nitric acids) in the weathering zone interact to control HCO23 production, and water throughput controls HCO23 transport into rivers. Human influences on HCO23 fluxes include climate warming, acid precipitation, mining, concrete use, and agricultural fertilization and liming. We currently cannot evaluate the net result of human influences on a global scale but HCO23 fluxes are clearly increasing in some major rivers as shown here for much of the United States. This increase could be partly a return to pre-industrial HCO23 fluxes as anthropogenic acidification has been mitigated in the United States, but elsewhere around the world anthropogenic acidification could be leading to decreased concentrations and fluxes.},

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr(-1) from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr(-1) is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

Virtual worlds offer an attractive proposition to create 3D representations of real business environments to provide an authentic learning activity for higher education students to take part in. However, the controls and displays are still clunky and unnatural, reducing the opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the event and focus on experiential learning. To overcome this challenge we examine the role of using a headset display that allows the user to change perspective with a flick of the head, improving their ability to `feel' part of the environment, and thus increase their immersion in the activities that they are engaged in through more realistic control and improved perspective in the virtual environment. A series of experiments are conducted comparing the technology to established technologies and the level of control exerted by the learner (e.g., they either `control' or they `passively observe' as someone else controls). These experiments provide evidence that consumer-technology can improve immersion and equip educators with an affordable instrument to present classes that learners `take more seriously'.},

Due to lack of time, resources and innovation, the language classroom is limited in its possibilities of promoting authentic communication. Therefore, the researchers investigated how to induce a VR setting with information gaps, for which they designed a template which intrinsically promotes communication and the students' confidence in using EFL. Thereby, VR enables the simulation of real life situations, creating both comfortable and authentic training environments. The game content is based on the internationally approved Graded Examination in Spoken English (GESE) Trinity Exam and can be adapted to the needs of the learners or the given curricula. The empirical analysis shows that the designed game trains the students' communication skills, evoking a high amount of speech and a qualitative linguistic output.},

Virtual and Augmented Reality have a clear potential in education and can solve this problem. Serious games that use immersive technologies allow students to visit and interact with environments dated in different ages. Taking this in mind, this article presents a playful virtual reality experience set in Ancient Rome that allows the user to learn concepts from that age. The virtual experience reproduces as accurately as possible the different buildings and civil constructions of the time, making it possible for the player to create Roman cities in a simple way. Once built, the user can visit them, accessing the buildings and being able to interact with the objects and characters that appear. Moreover, in order to learn more information about every building, users can visualize them using Augmented Reality using marker-based techniques. Different information has been included related to every building, such as their main uses, characteristics, or even some images that represent them. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed experience, several experiments have been carried out, taking as sample Secondary School students. Initially, the game's quality and playability has been evaluated and, subsequently, the motivation of the virtual learning experience in history. The results obtained support on the one hand its gameplay and attractiveness, and on the other, the student's increased interest in studying history, as well as the greater fixation of different concepts treated in a playful experience.},

Approximate 210--220~kg~ha-1 N fertilizer was applied in millions of small plots through broadcasting way in China, resulting in over and loss of N fertilizers. However, it is difficult to implement advanced management practices on smallholder farms due to a lack of knowledge. Here, using 35,502 on-farm fertilization experiments, we demonstrated that smallholders in China could actually produce more grain with less N fertilizer use only through optimizing N application rate. The yields of wheat, maize and rice were shown to increase between 10\% and 19\% while N application rates were reduced by 15--19\%. These changes resulted in an increase in N use efficiency (NUE) by 32--46\% and a reduction in N surplus by 40\% without actually changing farmers' operational practices. By reducing N application rates in line with official recommendations would not only save fertilizer cost while increasing crop yield, but also at the same time reduce environmental N pollution in China. Beyond of optimizing N application rate, improved management practices were required to produce more grain with less pollution, which would need about 11.8 billion US dollars for the implementation and reducing N loss reduction by 1.75 million tons to the environment.},

This fascinating group of organisms also has applications in modern agriculture through facilitating increased nutrient availability, maintaining the organic carbon and fertility of soil, and enhancing plant growth and crop yields, as a result of stimulation of soil microbial activity. Several cyanobacteria provide nitrogen fertilization through biological nitrogen fixation and through enzymatic activities related to interconversions and mobilization of different forms of nitrogen. Both green algae and cyanobacteria are involved in the production of metabolites such as growth hormones, polysaccharides, antimicrobial compounds, etc., which play an important role in the colonization of plants and proliferation of microbial and eukaryotic communities in soil. Currently, the development of consortia of cyanobacteria with bacteria or fungi or microalgae or their biofilms has widened their scope of utilization. Development of integrated wastewater treatment and biomass production systems is an emerging technology, which exploits the nutrient sequestering potential of microalgae and its valorisation. This review focuses on prospects and challenges of application of microalgae in various areas of agriculture, including crop production, protection and natural resource management. An overview of the recent advances, novel technologies developed, their commercialization status and future directions are also included.},

However, fundamental questions remain about how user performance is affected by such factors as graphics refresh rate, resolution, control latencies, and multimodal feedback. This article reports on two experiments performed to examine dextrous manipulation of virtual objects. The first experiment studies the effect of graphics frame rate and viewing mode (monoscopic vs. stereoscopic) on the time required to grasp a moving target. The second experiment studies the effect of direct force feedback, pseudoforce feedback, and redundant force feedback on grasping force regulation. The trials were performed using a partially-immersive environment (graphics workstation and LCD glasses), a DataGlove, and the Rutgers Master with force feedback. Results of the first experiment indicate that stereoscopic viewing is beneficial for low refresh rates (it reduced task completion time by about 50\% vs. monoscopic graphics). Results of the second experiment indicate that haptic feedback increases performance and reduces error rates, as compared to the open loop case (with no force feedback). The best performance was obtained when both direct haptic and redundant auditory feedback were provided to the user. The large number of subjects participating in these experiments (over 160 male and female) indicates good statistical significance for the above results.},

The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.},

In the first experiment, participants experienced complex unusual and unexpected events happening in a virtual reality. In the second experiment, participants were confronted with schema-violations. In both experiments, comparisons with various control groups showed that a diversifying experience -- defined as the active (but not vicarious) involvement in an unusual event -- increased cognitive flexibility more than active (or vicarious) involvement in normal experiences. Our findings bridge several lines of research and shed light on a basic cognitive mechanism responsible for creativity.},

However, exclusive use of microalgae as an energy feedstocks cannot warrant their scalability and economical sustainability due to the high cost involved in their biomass processing. The co-processing of microalgae biomass with other related bio-refinery applications can offset their cost and improve their sustainability. Thus, it triggers up the need of exploring the potential of microalgae biomass beyond their typical use. Microalgae offer interesting features to qualify them as alternative feedstocks for various bio-refinery applications. Microalgae have unique abilities to utilize them for industrial and environmental applications. Thus, this review discusses to expand the scope of integrating microalgae with other biotechnological applications to enhance their sustainability. The use of microalgae as a feed for animal and aquaculture, fertilizers, medicine, cosmetic, environmental and other biotechnological applications is thoroughly reviewed. It also highlights the barriers, opportunities, developments, and prospects of extending the scope of microalgae. This study concludes that sustained research funding, and a shift of microalgae focus from biofuels production to bio-refinery co-products can qualify them as promising feedstocks. Moreover, technology integration is inevitable to off-set the cost of microalgae biomass processing. It is expected that this study would be helpful to determine the future role of microalgae in bio-refinery applications.},

These findings have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Virtual reality-delivered exposure therapy for PTSD has been previously used with reports of positive outcomes. The current paper will detail the development and early results from use of the Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system. The system consists of a series of customizable virtual scenarios designed to represent relevant Middle Eastern contexts for exposure therapy, including a city and desert road convoy environment. The process for gathering user-centered design feedback from returning OEF/OIF military personnel and from a system deployed in Iraq (as was needed to iteratively evolve the system) will be discussed, along with a brief summary of results from an open clinical trial using Virtual Iraq with 20 treatment completers, which indicated that 16 no longer met PTSD checklist-military criteria for PTSD after treatment.},

Another aim is to understand the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of the literature on the subject and identify the knowledge base of the use of VR in education and whether it is commonly used and integrated into teaching--learning processes. To do this, articles indexed in the Main Collections of the Web of Science, Scopus and Lens were analyzed for the period 2010 to 2021. The research results are presented in two parts: the first is a quantitative analysis that provides an overview of virtual reality (VR) technology used in the educational field, with tables, graphs, and maps, highlighting the main performance indicators for the production of articles and their citation. The results obtained found a total of 718 articles of which the following were analyzed 273 published articles. The second stage consisted of an inductive type of analysis that found six major groups in the cited articles, which are instruction and learning using VR, VR learning environments, use of VR in different fields of knowledge, learning processes using VR applications or games, learning processes employing simulation, and topics published during the Covid-19 pandemic. Another important aspect to mention is that VR is used in many different areas of education, but until the beginning of the pandemic the use of this so-called ``disruptive process'' came mainly from students, Institutions were reluctant and slow to accept and include VR in the teaching--learning processes.},

However, performing experiments in real conditions is usually expensive in terms of time, money and energy, as it requires expensive infrastructures that are generally difficult to maintain in good conditions. To overcome this problem, virtual reality has proven to be a powerful tool to achieve sustainability, making it easy to update laboratories without the need to acquire new equipment. Moreover, the ability to introduce practical knowledge into classrooms without leaving them, makes virtual laboratories capable of simulating typical operating environments as well as extreme situations in the operation of different devices. A typical subject in which students can benefit from the use of virtual laboratories is robotics. In this work we will develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) pedagogical simulator of industrial robotic arms for engineering students. With the proposed system, students will know the effects of their own designed trajectories on several different robotic arms and cell environments without having to buy all of them and being safe of damaging the cell components. The simulation will be checking for collisions of the elements in the scene and alert the student when they happen. This can be achieved with a robotic simulator, but the integration with immersive VR is intended to help students better understand robotics. Moreover, even having a real robotic arm available for students, with this proposed VR method, all the students have the opportunity to manage and learn his own version of the robotic cell, without waiting times generated by having less robotic arms than students in classroom.},

Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg               et al.               report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species---those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend.

Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29\% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period. This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This research proposed a 3D multiuser virtual learning environment (3DMUVLE) educational game design framework by combining ATMSG, ADDIE, E-Simulation, and 3D Open Simulator Technology Architecture. This paper focused on a case study of online training for food crops productivity data surveys. Background: The conventional online training still lacks engagement, immersion, and curiosity aspects, which decreases learners' learning seriousness because the instructors and participants do not meet directly. Integration of 3DMUVLE and gamification in online training has a good potential to tackle the issue. Methodology: This research applied the Design Research Method (DRM) to propose a 3DMUVLE educational game design framework. The proposed framework was applied in training that involved 30 participants (first group), and the result was compared with that of 30 other participants (second group) who studied using the conventional method, which was an e-book and web-based learning. Authors compared the perceived usefulness and heightened enjoyment in using the proposed 3DMUVLE using linear regression analysis on HMSAM model. Contribution: Through statistical tests on the case study data, this research indicated that the 3DMUVLE resulted in better knowledge gain. Findings: Some important findings in this paper include (1) the development steps of a 3DMUVLE educational game design framework for online training of food crops productivity data survey; (2) statistical analysis result that the proposed 3DMUVLE lead to better knowledge gain, enjoyment, curiosity, immersion, and usefulness aspects; (3) the statistical analytic also showed that enjoyment and perceived of usefulness factors represented the strongest variables that influenced behavioral intention to use. Recommendations for Practitioners: The 3DMUVLE is suggested to produce better knowledge gain, yet it still has to be proven further through similar statistical analysis in real field survey scenarios. Recommendation for Researchers: The proposed 3DMUVLE can be adapted to other domains. Pleasing features in the game can be improved, such as quality of instruction in the simulation, in the hope that these will increase engagement and knowledge gain. Voice communication among users and instructors to improve interactivity may also be introduced. Impact on Society: 3DMUVLE potentially offers better knowledge gain that can be applied in various fields of online training.  Future Research: An immediate future research includes a development targeted for smartphone platform, in Virtual Reality (VR) or non-VR mode. VR improves immersion aspect further but is more complicated to perform. Smartphone is relatively cheaper than a computer and more accessible by more people. Training using a smartphone-based 3DMUVLE can be carried out in wider scenarios.},

The ways our cultural heritage reserve is preserved and disseminated to the public have changed significantly, with the use of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality environments, and serious games. Nowadays, these technologies are also exploited for developing interactive informative applications, to support historical education and enhance museum visits, physical or virtual, especially to younger generations. The field of edutainment, educational entertainment, has been rapidly developing during the last 10 or 15 years. The main goal of this research is to develop an educational 3D puzzle-like serious game which can operate within a virtual reality environment while aiming towards the dissemination of cultural heritage content to the younger public, i.e., students, children etc., through a pleasant gamification process. The cultural heritage objects used are an ancient Greek temple and a statue of the Roman era, whose high-resolution fully textured 3D models were available from previous projects. The game application was developed in Unity game engine with suitable coding to enable the smooth execution of the 3D puzzle solution. The application verified that it is more interesting to learn about cultural assets through a game than in the conventional ways, and even more when it is implemented within a Virtual Reality environment, where the contact with the assets appears to be more direct and realistic. The same application can also be utilized in different educational areas and can be expanded by the inclusion of other digital assets.},

This is not a trend limited to the entertainment domain; non-formal learning environments for children are also following this path, backed up by a theoretical notion of play as a core activity in a childs development. In this article we explore a central thread in learning, play, as well as an essential characteristic of virtual reality environments: interactivity. A critical review of examples of immersive virtual reality worlds created for children, with particular attention given to the role and nature of interactivity, is attempted. Interactivity is examined in relation to learning, play, narrative, and to characteristics inherent in virtual reality, such as immersion, presence, and the creation of illusion.},

  abstract = {In plant cells, ammonium is considered the most convenient nitrogen source for cell metabolism. However, despite ammonium being the preferred N form for microalgae, at higher concentrations, it can be toxic, and can cause growth inhibition. Microalgae's tolerance to ammonium depends on the species, with various taxa showing different thresholds of tolerability and symptoms of toxicity. In the environment, ammonium at high concentrations represents a dangerous pollutant. It can affect water quality, causing numerous environmental problems, including eutrophication of downstream waters. For this reason, it is important to treat wastewater and remove nutrients before discharging it into rivers, lakes, or seas. A valid and sustainable alternative to conventional treatments could be provided by microalgae, coupling the nutrient removal from wastewater with the production of valuable biomass. This review is focused on ammonium and its importance in algal nutrition, but also on its problematic presence in aquatic systems such as wastewaters. The aim of this work is to provide recent information on the exploitation of microalgae in ammonium removal and the role of ammonium in microalgae metabolism.},

  abstract = {Intensive livestock farming has negatively impacted the environment by contributing to the release of ammonia and nitrous oxide, groundwater nitrate pollution and eutrophication of rivers and estuaries. The nitrogen footprint calculator has predicted the large impact of meat production on global nitrogen loss, but it could not form the relationship between meat production and the corresponding manure generation. Here we report on the formation of direct relationships between beef, pork and poultry meat production and the corresponding amount of nitrogen loss through manure. Consequently, the energy demand for ammonium nitrogen recovery from manure is also reported. Nitrogen loss to the environment per unit of meat production was found directly proportional to the virtual nitrogen factors. The relationship between total nitrogen intake and the corresponding nitrogen loss per kg of meat production was also found linear. Average nitrogen loss due to manure application was calculated at 110 g kg-1 for poultry. The average nitrogen loss increased to 190 and 370 g-N kg-1 for pork and beef productions, respectively. Additionally, 147 kg ammonium nitrogen was calculated to be recovered from 123 m3 of manure. This corresponded to 1 Mg of beef production. The recovery of ammonium nitrogen was reduced to 126 and 52 kg from 45 and 13 m3 of pork and poultry manure, respectively. The ammonium nitrogen recovery values were calculated with respect to 1 Mg of both pork and poultry meat productions. Consequently, the specific energy demand of ammonium nitrogen recovery from beef manure was noticed at 49 kWh kg-1, which was significantly 57\% and 69\% higher than that of pork and poultry manure, respectively.},

  abstract = {Instances of range contraction and population decline in bird species in Europe are more common than cases of recovery following decline. Here we report on the recovery and expansion processes of an endangered bird species in Europe, the purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio L., Rallidae), with special reference to the Iberian Peninsula, its main distribution area in Western Europe. After a drastic decline during the first half of the 20th century, which restricted its range to a few areas in southern Spain, the Iberian population has recovered. Currently, the species occurs in a range similar to the one it had at the beginning of the 20th century, and has even colonized new areas. These processes seem to be the result of both human-mediated (effective protection of the species and suitable habitats; success of reintroduction programs as expansion focuses of birds colonizing nearby and distant regions [{$>$}300 km] wetlands) and natural factors (inter- and intra-seasonal cycles of wet and dry years). Thus, we found a significant relationship between rainfall and bird abundance and productivity, suggesting that such inter- and intra-seasonal cycles may have significant effects on demographic parameters that could be related to the expansion process. Finally the species shows remarkable adaptability, as proven by data on breeding success in recently colonized areas and the ability to breed shortly after reintroduction. We hypothesize that saturation of breeding habitats in established areas, a reasonable habitat continuity and favorable environmental conditions, and protection have facilitated the dispersion of birds.},

  abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (iVR) devices are rapidly becoming an important part of our lives and forming a new way for people to interact with computers and each other. The impact and consequences of this innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual environment (CIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience of users in a CIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed during their CIVE experience and then interviewed either in a semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience. Four superordinate themes---with detailed descriptions of experiences shared by numerous participants---emerged as results from the analysis; we called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The Surprising ``Fun with Maps'', (3) Communication as a challenge, and (4) Cognition in two realities. The findings of the study indicate the importance of the social dimension during education in a virtual environment and the effectiveness of dynamic and interactive 3D visualization.},

Undeveloped eggs have previously been attributed to male infertility, but recent studies of non-threatened bird species suggest fertilisation failure is rare in the wild. The underlying causes of fertilisation failure and embryo death differ, so distinguishing between them is essential for effective conservation management. Here we show that the majority (72\%, n = 124) of undeveloped k{\=a}k{\=a}p{\=o} eggs are fertilised, and combine this with conservation programme data on natural copulations, artificial inseminations, and paternity of developed eggs, to generate the most precise estimate to date of fertility in a wild population. We also demonstrate, for the first time in a wild bird, that artificial insemination results in greater numbers of sperm reaching the egg.},

We investigated potential shifts in ecosystem functions that provide energy for freshwater ecosystems due to pesticides and salinity in 24 sites in streams of southeast Australia. First, effects on allochthonous organic matter (AOM) breakdown using three different substrates (leaves, cotton strips, wood sticks) in coarse and fine bags were investigated. Second, we examined effects on stream metabolism that delivers information on the ecosystem functions of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. We found up to a fourfold reduction in AOM breakdown due to exposure to pesticides and salinity, where both stressors contributed approximately equally to the reduction. The effect was additive as, no interaction or correlation between the two stressors was found. Leaf breakdown responded strongly and exclusively to exposure to pesticides and salinity, whereas cotton strip breakdown was less sensitive and responded also to other stressors such as nutrients. No functional redundancy for the effects of pesticides and salinity on leaf breakdown was observed. For wood stick breakdown, no relationship to environmental gradients was found, however, the sample size was lower. We did not detect effects of pesticides or salinity on gross primary production or ecosystem respiration. A reduction in AOM breakdown by pesticides and salinity may impair the ecosystem services of food provision and possibly water purification. Hence, future studies should examine the spatial extent of these effects.},

In essence, we are searching for a 3-D user interface metaphor as powerful as the desktop metaphor for 2-D. At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment. In the first part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality, and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches--- augmented reality, projection displays, and ubiquitous computing---to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a twohanded, pen-and-pad interface that has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multitasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture is a user interface management system for complex augmented reality applications. The presentation is complemented by selected application examples.},

Although many studies continue to define the properties of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial biofilms, there is still much to learn, especially about how structural characteristics help bridge the gap between the chemistry and physical aspects of the matrix. Here, we show that membrane vesicles (MVs), structures derived from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, are a common particulate feature of the matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Biofilms grown using different model systems and growth conditions were shown to contain MVs when thin sectioned for transmission electron microscopy, and mechanically disrupted biofilms revealed MVs in association with intercellular material. MVs were also isolated from biofilms by employing techniques for matrix isolation and a modified MV isolation protocol. Together these observations verified the presence and frequency of MVs and indicated that MVs were a definite component of the matrix. Characterization of planktonic and biofilm-derived MVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences between the two and indicated functional roles, such as proteolytic activity and binding of antibiotics. The ubiquity of MVs was supported by observations of biofilms from a variety of natural environments outside the laboratory and established MVs as common biofilm constituents. MVs appear to be important and relatively unacknowledged particulate components of the matrix of gram-negative or mixed bacterial biofilms.},

On the basis of these experiments, a mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation is formulated which is in accord with the available enzymological evidence. The key reactions of the substrates of nitrogenase occur at a molybdenum active site. The non-heme iron, which is bound to sulfur and protein-S⊝ groups, mediates the transport of electrons to the molybdenum active site but does not participate directly in the reduction of the substrates. ATP is required for the acceleration of the reduction and activation of the molybdenum site and is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate. Diimine and hydrazine were detected as intermediates in the reduction of molecular nitrogen under nonenzymatic conditions.},

  abstract = {The goal of this experiment was to compare the effectiveness of training a procedural task in two simulated environments (desktop and virtual reality [VR]) and to examine the impact of different interaction methods in VR (gesture-based and voice-based). Traditional desktop-based computer simulations may create learning environments different from VR systems due to differences in task presentation (i.e., 2D versus 3D) and interaction method (i.e., clicking a mouse versus physically moving), which may influence presence and usability. Previous theoretical work purports that simulations that are more immersive, such as VR, should foster a sense of presence and lead to higher learning outcomes (see Witmer and Singer 1998), but these claims remain largely untested. Therefore, we compared two VR conditions and a desktop training condition to determine and examine the influence of presence and usability on recall. Seventy-five college students learned how to replace an alternator in one of three training conditions. Following the training, participants completed a presence questionnaire, usability questionnaire, and written recall test to assess how well they learned the procedure. We found no significant differences among the groups on presence, usability, or recall performance. Furthermore, we found no relationship between presence and recall, but a moderated mediation analysis indicated that usability predicted recall, but only for those receiving low immersion (i.e., desktop) training. That is, for desktop training, those who rated usability lower recalled fewer procedural steps. Contrary to theory, our results suggest that presence is not predictive of learning outcomes in more immersive simulations.},

  abstract = {Within an embodied cognition framework, it is argued that presence in a virtual environment (VE) develops from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VE. Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N = 246 and N = 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of ``realness'' were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was developed and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies.},

This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.},

Since changes in biodiversity in response to human impact are known to differ widely among taxonomic groups and guilds, there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate experts. We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops. As expected, overall species richness tended to decrease within this gradient of increasing habitat modification, but, in contrast to previous studies, we found the species richness between most taxonomic groups to be significantly correlated (36 out of 38 pairwise comparisons). However, on average only 48\% of the variance could be explained (within the five main groups), and only a few taxonomic groups/guilds turned out to be good predictors for others: for example, trees for fruit- and nectar-feeding birds (88\% explanation) and fruit-feeding butterflies (83\%), endemic birds for endemic butterflies (72\%), and frugivorous/nectar-feeding birds for fruit-feeding butterflies (67\%). Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification. Near-primary forest sites proved to be of principal importance for conservation; however, land-use systems such as secondary forests (for understory plants, birds, and butterflies) and agroforestry systems (for butterflies) supported relatively high numbers of species and might play a significant role for biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes.},

A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of 'being' or 'acting', when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires' mean scores; however, we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that, besides reducing a study's duration and reducing disorientation, completing questionnaires in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.},

This long-term tracer study revealed that three decades after application of isotopically labeled fertilizer N to agricultural soils in 1982, 12--15\% of the fertilizer-derived N was still residing in the soil organic matter, while 8--12\% of the fertilizer N had already leaked toward the groundwater. Part of the remaining fertilizer N still residing in the soil is predicted to continue to be taken up by crops and to leak toward the groundwater in the form of nitrate for at least another five decades, much longer than previously thought.           ,                             Increasing diffuse nitrate loading of surface waters and groundwater has emerged as a major problem in many agricultural areas of the world, resulting in contamination of drinking water resources in aquifers as well as eutrophication of freshwaters and coastal marine ecosystems. Although empirical correlations between application rates of N fertilizers to agricultural soils and nitrate contamination of adjacent hydrological systems have been demonstrated, the transit times of fertilizer N in the pedosphere--hydrosphere system are poorly understood. We investigated the fate of isotopically labeled nitrogen fertilizers in a three--decade-long in situ tracer experiment that quantified not only fertilizer N uptake by plants and retention in soils, but also determined to which extent and over which time periods fertilizer N stored in soil organic matter is rereleased for either uptake in crops or export into the hydrosphere. We found that 61--65\% of the applied fertilizers N were taken up by plants, whereas 12--15\% of the labeled fertilizer N were still residing in the soil organic matter more than a quarter century after tracer application. Between 8--12\% of the applied fertilizer had leaked toward the hydrosphere during the 30-y observation period. We predict that additional exports of               15               N-labeled nitrate from the tracer application in 1982 toward the hydrosphere will continue for at least another five decades. Therefore, attempts to reduce agricultural nitrate contamination of aquatic systems must consider the long-term legacy of past applications of synthetic fertilizers in agricultural systems and the nitrogen retention capacity of agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Many university-taught courses moved to online form since the outbreak of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Distance learning has become broadly used as a result of the widely applied lockdowns, however, many students lack personal contact in the learning process. A classical web-based distance learning does not provide means for natural interpersonal interaction. The technology of immersive virtual reality (iVR) may mitigate this problem. Current research has been aimed mainly at specific instances of collaborative immersive virtual environment (CIVE) applications for learning. The fields utilizing iVR for knowledge construction and skills training with the use of spatial visualizations show promising results. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative and individual use of iVR for learning geography, specifically training in hypsography. Furthermore, the study's goals were to determine whether collaborative learning would be more effective and to investigate the key elements in which collaborative and individual learning were expected to differ--motivation and use of cognitive resources. The CIVE application developed at Masaryk University was utilized to train 80 participants in inferring conclusions from cartographic visualizations. The collaborative and individual experimental group underwent a research procedure consisting of a pretest, training in iVR, posttest, and questionnaires. A statistical comparison between the geography pretest and posttest for the individual learning showed a significant increase in the score (p = 0.024, ES = 0.128) and speed (p = 0.027, ES = 0.123), while for the collaborative learning, there was a significant increase in the score (p{$<$}0.001, ES = 0.333) but not in speed (p = 1.000, ES = 0.000). Thus, iVR as a medium proved to be an effective tool for learning geography. However, comparing the collaborative and individual learning showed no significant difference in the learning gain (p = 0.303, ES = 0.115), speed gain (p = 0.098, ES = 0.185), or performance motivation (p = 0.368, ES = 0.101). Nevertheless, the collaborative learning group had significantly higher use of cognitive resources (p = 0.046, ES = 0.223) than the individual learning group. The results were discussed in relation to the cognitive load theories, and future research directions for iVR learning were proposed.},

  abstract = {We describe a theoretical model of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying conscious presence and its disturbances. The model is based on interoceptive prediction error and is informed by predictive models of agency, general models of hierarchical predictive coding and dopaminergic signaling in cortex, the role of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in interoception and emotion, and cognitive neuroscience evidence from studies of virtual reality and of psychiatric disorders of presence, specifically depersonalization/derealization disorder. The model associates presence with successful suppression by top-down predictions of informative interoceptive signals evoked by autonomic control signals and, indirectly, by visceral responses to afferent sensory signals. The model connects presence to agency by allowing that predicted interoceptive signals will depend on whether afferent sensory signals are determined, by a parallel predictive-coding mechanism, to be self-generated or externally caused. Anatomically, we identify the AIC as the likely locus of key neural comparator mechanisms. Our model integrates a broad range of previously disparate evidence, makes predictions for conjoint manipulations of agency and presence, offers a new view of emotion as interoceptive inference, and represents a step toward a mechanistic account of a fundamental phenomenological property of consciousness.},

We argue here for a particular view of games---and of learning---as activities that are most powerful when they are personally meaningful, experiential, social, and epistemological all at the same time. From this perspective, we describe an approach to the design of learning environments that builds on the educational properties of games, but deeply grounds them within a theory of learning appropriate for an age marked by the power of new technologies. We argue that to understand the future of learning, we have to look beyond schools to the emerging arena of video games. We suggest that video games matter because they present players with simulated worlds: worlds which, if well constructed, are not just about facts or isolated skills, but embody particular social practices. Video games thus make it possible for players to participate in valued communities of practice and as a result develop the ways of thinking that organize those practices. Most educational games to date have been produced in the absence of any coherent theory of learning or underlying body of research. We argue here for such a theory---and for research that addresses the important questions about this relatively new medium that such a theory implies.},

Research results have consistently shown that CL improves students' academic achievement as well as social interaction when carried out responsibly. CL methods and procedures are designed to promote cooperation and mutual assistance among learners and often carry over to relationships outside the school. Translating the promise of CL to practice is more complicated than meets the eye, and does not always guarantee that its desired goals are achieved. This article sets out to explore some of the causes of the discrepancy between the promise and practice of CL, such as confusion about methods, lack of adequate preparation, and teachers' perceptions of teaching in general and of CL in particular.},

We present an innovative approach that offers better e-learning than the previous virtual reality educational applications. The proposed method supplies learners with autonomy in virtual communications, allowing learners to achieve a variety of shared goals. The traditional text-based or web-based virtual reality systems are generally less attractive to students because of their lack of 3D immersion and real-time voice interaction. Three-D virtual reality technology can be exploited to compensate these weaknesses. We propose an immersive and interactive virtual English classroom, entitled VEC3D, that integrates a goal-based instructional design, vivid 3D graphics, and real-time voice communication. The ultimate goal of the VEC3D project is to enhance learners' English communicative competence. This research determines how learners perceive their experiences in the virtual space and use communication strategies (CSs) in the process of advancing communicative competence. The recent ethnographic study results revealed that the proposed application promoted positive student attitude and interactive learning experiences.},

According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner's part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback's success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback.},

On the one hand, these perspectives focus on the change of individual perspectives of meaning; on the other hand, they focus on collective processes of emancipation. Secondly, it will be reflected, how far these approaches of transformative learning can considerably enrich the idea of transformative education by adding pedagogical perspectives.},

Furthermore, we critically review recent research concerning the effectiveness of embodiment interventions and develop a taxonomy to more properly characterize research on embodied cognition. The main dimensions of this taxonomy are bodily engagement (i.e. how much bodily activity is involved) and task integration (i.e. whether bodily activities are related to a learning task in a meaningful way or not). By locating studies on the 2 {\texttimes} 2 grid resulting from this taxonomy and assessing the corresponding learning outcomes, we identify opportunities, problems, and challenges of research on embodied learning.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the concepts of immersion and presence in virtual environments (VEs). We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE Conference in London, UK.},

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is `being there', often called `presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not `there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.},

Students were randomly assigned to a group (two levels of immersive VRS and a control group) to learn the skill of decontamination. Cognitive learning, performance, and performance time were measured pre/post and at six months.ResultsOutcome measures were significant with immediate postintervention improvements and lower retention scores at six months. No significant differences were noted between groups. Students were satisfied with the VRS but found immersive VRS more interactive.ConclusionVRS provides another alternative for simulated learning experiences; best practice approaches for its use still need to be explored.},

Immersive virtual reality mediated through head-mounted displays presents significant challenges as well as tantalising opportunities for learning within schools. The purpose of this paper is to report on key issues that arose when embedding immersive virtual reality for learning into ICT and science classes in low-income high schools by providing a fine-grained account of how the research team negotiated scholarly and practical problems. The mixed method research used a participatory approach with teachers as co-researchers. Three areas are explored: (i) the ethical and safety issues of using IVR in classrooms; (ii) negotiating the organisational context of a school system and problem-solving within the context of institutional restrictions on internet access; and (iii) educational reflections on collaborative learning and gendered dynamics. We conclude that classrooms, as socially active and sometimes unpredictable places, yield unique and credible insights into the deployment of highly immersive virtual reality for learning.

Its goal is to build a more replicable and robust science; it does so using new technologies, altering incentives, and changing attitudes. The current movement towards open science was spurred, in part, by a recent ``series of unfortunate events'' within psychology and other sciences. These events include the large number of studies that have failed to replicate and the prevalence of common research and publication procedures that could explain why. Many journals and funding agencies now encourage, require, or reward some open science practices, including pre-registration, providing full materials, posting data, distinguishing between exploratory and confirmatory analyses, and running replication studies. Individuals can practice and encourage open science in their many roles as researchers, authors, reviewers, editors, teachers, and members of hiring, tenure, promotion, and awards committees. A plethora of resources are available to help scientists, and science, achieve these goals.},

For example, (i) microalgae can be used to enhance the nutritional value of food and animal feed owing to their chemical composition, (ii) they play a crucial role in aquaculture and (iii) they can be incorporated into cosmetics. Moreover, they are cultivated as a source of highly valuable molecules. For example, polyunsaturated fatty acid oils are added to infant formulas and nutritional supplements and pigments are important as natural dyes. Stable isotope biochemicals help in structural determination and metabolic studies. Future research should focus on the improvement of production systems and the genetic modification of strains. Microalgal products would in that way become even more diversified and economically competitive.},

This study focuses on serious games, and how users can increase their understanding of sustainability issues and their familiarity with sustainable development strategies. ``Users'' of serious games consist of all possible target groups that are interested in attaining knowledge of sustainability through the use of games that are designed for a purpose beyond entertainment, in this case for sustainability education. This paper follows the systematic literature review method to deliver a study of serious games featuring sustainable development practices and policies. In order to provide a thorough analysis of their dynamic features, 77 games were explored in this study. The findings show the growing number of serious games that seek to educate in sustainability and the categorization of these games according to the triple-bottom line of sustainability, giving clarification hints to users wishing to select the relevant tool that offers an understanding of specific sustainability issues. The purpose of such research is to reveal the contribution of serious games as effective tools in facilitating sustainability education and to group them according to their nature and direction in relation to sustainability. Limitations in their effectiveness are also identified and a research agenda for new, relevant serious games is proposed that will enhance holistic knowledge and make it easier to clarify their pedagogical basis. The recipients of the findings will be all those future users and trainers who are interested in accessing sustainability education patterns through the use of serious games. This study will enable them to select the serious game that best serves their needs.},

This paper applies motion-sickness adaptation theory to cybersickness in virtual environments to determine if the degree of user-initiated control can suppress sickness. It is suggested that if users are allowed some level of control over their movement within a virtual environment, cybersickness will not be as severe as that resulting from an enviornment in which users must follow a predetermined (i.e., scripted) path of movement. While past motion-sickness studies have examined control versus no control, the present study focuses on modifying the level of user-initiated control such that it matches the needs of the task characteristics while minimizing sickness. The degree of user sickness was tested under passive, active, and active-passive control scenarios. As measured by the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, the active (i.e., complete control) condition reduced the severity of the symptoms experienced as compared to the passive (i.e., no control) condition, but did not do so as completely as the active-passive (i.e., coupled control) condition. The implication is that the level of user-initiated control can be manipulated to modify the deleterious effects of human-virtual environment interaction.},

Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries---climate change and biosphere integrity---have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

Benefits provided by immersive virtual reality in educational setting were recognised in the past decades, however mass application was left out due to the lack of development and high price. Intensive development of new platforms and virtual reality devices in the last few years started up with Oculus Rift, and subsequently accelerated in the year 2014 by occurrence of Google Cardboard. Nowadays, for the first time in history, immersive virtual reality is available to millions of people. In the mid 2015 Google commenced developing Expeditions Pioneer Program aiming to massively utilise the Google Cardboard platform in education. Expeditions and other VR apps can enhance geography teaching and learning. Realistic experience acquired by utilisation of virtual reality in teaching process significantly overcome possibilities provided by images and illustrations in the textbook. Besides literature review on usage of virtual reality in education this paper presents suggestion of VR mobile apps that can be used together with the Google Cardboard head mounted displays (HMDs) in geography classes, thereby emphasising advantages and disadvantages as well as possible obstacles which may occur in introducing the immersive virtual reality in the educational process.},

However, phototrophic biofilms are difficult to cultivate in submerged bioreactors. A new generation of biofilm photobioreactors imitates the natural habitat resulting in higher productivity. In this work, an aerosol-based photobioreactor is presented that was characterized for the cultivation of phototrophic biofilms. Experiments and simulation of aerosol distribution showed a uniform aerosol supply to biofilms. Compared to previous prototypes, the growth of the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. could be almost tripled. Different surfaces for biofilm growth were investigated regarding hydrophobicity, contact angle, light- and temperature distribution. Further, the results were successfully simulated. Finally, the growth of Nostoc sp. was investigated on different surfaces and the biofilm thickness was measured noninvasively using optical coherence tomography. It could be shown that the cultivation surface had no influence on biomass production, but did affect biofilm thickness.},

EPS mainly consist of water, polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids as well as lysis and hydrolysis products which makes the composition very complex. Thus, rough simplifications are used and commonly one or at most two components of the EPS are examined. In this work a new procedure for separation and analysis of EPS in the main components (i) polysaccharides, (ii) proteins and (iii) lipids is presented with recovery rates of nearly 100 \%. The method was established with synthetic EPS, which based on the composition of real EPS described in literature. Afterwards, the method was transferred to real EPS samples allowing a deeper insight in the composition of EPS from only one sample. The composition of EPS-extracts from Nostoc spec, cultivated under heterotrophic and mixotrophic batch and fed-batch conditions, was analysed during a cultivation period of 14 days. It was observed that mixotrophic cultivation led to higher amounts of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins than heterotrophic cultivation respectively, regardless of batch or fed-batch culture. While the amount of proteins in the EPS increased during the cultivation period, carbohydrates and lipids were dominant in the beginning and decreased afterwards.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity forms the basis for a large pool of potential products and productive organisms offered by terrestrial cyanobacteria. They are stuck together by EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) that can obtain antiviral, antibacterial or anti-inflammatory substances. Most stress conditions, e.g. drought, induce the production of protective EPS or biotechnological-products for pharmaceutical application. However, the growth of a phototrophic biofilm is limited under submerged conditions. Therefore, a semi-continuous process to produce EPS by cyanobacteria was developed in an aerosol-based ePBR (emerse photobioreactor) that imitates the natural habitat of terrestrial cyanobacteria. The process consists of a growth-phase (biomass production), followed by a dry-phase (EPS-production) and a consecutive extraction. The EPS-productivities of Trichocoleus sociatus (ranging from 0.03 to 0.04gL-1d-1) were 32 times higher than described in topic-related literature. In comparison to submerge cultivations in shaking flasks, the EPS-productivities were sevenfold higher. To ensure that the extraction solvent has no influence on cell viability, a cell-vitality-test was performed. However, no statistically significant difference between the amount of living and dead cells before and after the extraction was detected. A bioactivity assay was then performed to identify antimicrobial activity within EPS extracts from emerse and submerge cultivations. The EPS revealed an antibacterial effect against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) which was two times higher than EPS from a submerged cultivation.},

While practices and programs to reduce nitrogen fertilizer application continue to be developed, inefficient fertilizer use persists and little is known about farmer decision-making regarding application rates. The purpose of this study was to explore farmer decision-making in the context of reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer as a climate change mitigation strategy and to assess barriers to reduced application and participating in a potential offsets program. Research methods included mail surveys, interviews, and focus groups with corn farmers in Michigan, United States (US). Results indicate that potential barriers to increasing nitrogen use efficiency for climate change mitigation include: perceptions about climate change, limited access to information and technological tools, and constraints imposed by the political economy of US agriculture. Education programs, government subsidies or cost-sharing programs, and including influential market and political actors in discussions about fertilizer use and climate change mitigation may address some of these barriers. Policies and programs focused on nitrogen fertilizer use and climate change mitigation in agriculture should be aware of these barriers and how they might be addressed.},

  abstract = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

The coherence of quick mobile Internet access and presence of supplementary equipment enables to get trained or to self-dependently advance due to usage of virtual reality possibilities for education in the stationary classrooms, at home and in motion. Several important features of virtual reality, its advantages for education are discussed. It is noted that virtual reality is remaining a relatively new technology in language learning. Benefits from virtual reality implementation into foreign language learning and teaching are given. The aspects of immersion and gamification in foreign language learning are considered. It is emphasized that virtual reality creates necessary preconditions for motivation increasing. The results of the survey at two higher education institution as to personal experience in using VR applications for learning foreign languages are presented. Most students at both universities have indicated quite a low virtual reality application usage. Six popular virtual reality applications for foreign language learning (Mondly, VRSpeech, VR Learn English, Gold Lotus, AltSpaceVR and VirtualSpeech) are analyzed. It is stated that the most preferred VR application for foreign language learning includes detailed virtual environment for maximal immersion, high- level visual effects similar to video games, simple avatar control, thorough material selection and complete complicity level accordance of every element and aspect, affordability, helpful and unobtrusive following up.},

  abstract = {The paper gives an overview of how virtual reality (VR) literature and related sources describe the notion of immersion, its sub-types and similar terms. There are two main schools giving definitions for immersion in VR, and their definitions are quite different. One school, associated with B. Witmer and M. Singer, regards immersion as a psychological state of the user. The other school, based on the works of M. Slater, sees immersion as an objective characteristic of a VR system. Some authors call the first type of immersion ``psychological immersion'' and the second type ``technological immersion''. The authors of the present paper bring up the possibility of using alternative terms: ``immersedness'' for the immersion concept of the first school, and, for that of the second school, ``immersingness'' (denoting the actively immersing quality of the system) and ``immersing'' when referring to the act of immersing the user. The term ``immersedness'' is unambiguous, contrary to the term ``psychological immersion'' which could also mean a system characteristic when the system is created with the ability to try to manipulate the user with psychological means.},

This experiment let them experience the difference of interactions in microgravity and on the surface of the Earth. It is a visually and physically simulated whole body interactive VR environment where participants can intuitively explore physics of microgravity. The environment provides the possibility to perform reorientation strategies in microgravity. The digital tools that we used included Oculus Rift (DK1) head mounted display, Kinect (version 1) body tracking device, and a computer. We held a small user study to see if the system could improve the participants view about physics of microgravity. The results of this study show that the simulation was beneficial for participants and improved their ability to make better predictions about some interactions in microgravity.},

Hilton's review article (2016) provides synthesized evidence stating that OER can help decrease college students' textbook spending without undermining student learning effectiveness. It is also noteworthy that implementing OER in digital education needs additional considerations beyond the efficacy of OER.

Their subjective perceptions and objective measures were collected and analyzed. The results revealed that interactivity level and previous experience had an effect on subjective User eXperience and on objective usability. Framerate and field of view had an effect on objective usability. Finally, 3D content feedback had no significant influence on User eXperience. From these findings, key points for User eXperience practitioners are proposed.},

  abstract = {Irrigation is, on one hand, expected to increase the risk of nitrate leaching through increased rates of percolation, but, on the other hand, enhances plant nutrient uptake and growth, thereby limiting the risk of leaching. To investigate this dichotomy, we analysed the effects of irrigation at three nitrogen (N)-application rates in spring barley (Hordeum distichum L., two experiments with 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha-1) and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., one experiment with 50, 150, and 250 kg N ha-1) on a coarse sandy soil in Denmark in a humid climate, which facilitates nitrate leaching. Analyses comprised grain/seed dry matter yield, N-uptake, nitrogen use efficiency (partial nitrogen budget, PNB, and partial-factor productivity, PFP) and nitrate leaching. For both crops, increasing N-application without consideration of the crops' drought-stress responses lead to a relatively lower N-uptake in grain, lower yield, lower PNB and PFP and higher nitrate leaching, although responses were not proportionally to increasing N-application. The effect of irrigation at the lowest N-rates was limited. The non-irrigated treatments with the highest N-rates had a grain/seed yield of 3.2, 2.3 and 0.7 t ha-1 and nitrate leaching rates of 64, 72 and 127 kg N ha-1 compared to a grain/seed yield of 5.3, 5.0 and 2.6 kg N ha-1 and nitrate leaching rates of 61, 42 and 85 kg N ha-1 (for spring barley, spring barley and winter oilseed rape, respectively). These results show that synchronised management of both irrigation and N-application are essential for reducing the risk of nitrate leaching and to promote efficient crop N-uptake in periods of droughts.},

  abstract = {"The Pragmatic Programmer is one of those rare tech books you'll read, re-read, and read again over the years. Whether you're new to the field or an experienced practitioner, you'll come away with fresh insights each and every time. Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology, and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories. Now, twenty years later, this new edition re-examines what it means to be a modern programmer. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to: Fight software rot; Learn continuously; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Harness the power of basic tools; Avoid programming by coincidence; Learn real requirements; Solve the underlying problems of concurrent code; Guard against security vulnerabilities; Build teams of Pragmatic Programmers; Take responsibility for your work and career; Test ruthlessly and effectively, including property-based testing; Implement the Pragmatic Starter Kit; Delight your users. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with classic and fresh anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best approaches and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {Game-Based Learning (GBL) can take many forms. With the advancement and development of new technologies, some GBL experiences take on to new forms affected by those technologies, and therefore spawning new challenges and questions for both, theorists and developers. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that is gaining adepts in the world of learning and in the world of gaming. Augmented Reality Game-Based Learning (ARGBL) may be considered as the union of AR and GBL. The use of games with AR characteristics and AR applications structured with rules and game elements seem to be natural and effective ways to propose learning experiences. Nonetheless there is a lack of a review compiling their characteristics. It is important to recognize, what forms ARGBL can take, what uses it has been given, and how the experiences have been designed to inform new studies. In this chapter, a review of the literature is shown regarding ARGBL experiences and applications. The review classifies the works according to different criteria (Types of AR, Tracking Methods, Educational Field and Design Approach). In order to observe whether and how those works involved teachers during the design or development phase, special attention was paid to the Design Approach criterion under the consideration that inclusion of teachers in the design process can affect their appropriation of the games as educational tools. This chapter offers commentaries on the findings regarding the ARGBL works and based on this, the chapter also offers insights and discusses open-issues for future studies.},

Second, it is proposed that humans, but not other primates, understand the causal and intentional relations that hold among external entities. In the physical domain only humans understand causal forces as mediating the connection between sequentially ordered events; in the social domain only humans understand the behavior of others as intentionally directed and controlled by desired outcomes. Both these uniquely primate and these uniquely human cognitive skills are hypothesized to have their origins in adaptations for negotiating complex social interactions.},

However, even though the educational potential of games has been thoroughly discussed in the literature, the integration of the games into educational processes and how to efficiently deliver the games to the students are still open questions. This paper addresses the aspects of integration and automatic deployment of educational games in Learning Management Systems. This integration simplifies the introduction of games in educational settings, leveraging the pre-existing technological infrastructure. Our approach is based on the automatic packaging and exportation of games as self-contained Learning Objects that can be easily distributed through any LMS compliant with the current interoperability standards. We thus inherit the advantages of the Learning Object model in terms of interoperability and, when supported by the LMS, in terms of student tracking and assessment.},

Results revealed that set-aside soil was characterised by slower organic carbon turnover and better humification efficiency with respect to the arable soil. This study confirms that the restoration practice can establish a self-sustaining plant and microrganisms community, which is naturally evolving in the direction of the original, stable ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease inherited from birth which affects many parts of the human body. One effect is the chronic overproduction of mucus within the lungs. In addition to medication, this mucus production requires multiple varying daily physiotherapy techniques in an effort to clear. Despite this necessity, adherence to such clearance techniques remains low. Games and gamification techniques have proven to benefit many sectors such as education, learning and medicine. Game engines can provide a platform for the development of such educational games with the added benefit of multiple platforms for deployment, including Windows and Mac executables, web and, a virtual reality head mounted display executable. However a virtual reality game to disseminate CF education has yet to be created. This paper proposes such a game for use on a the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2. The system was designed by implementing educational pedagogy theory and gamification elements such as interest points, an objective, player pawn navigation and gaming inputs such as a gamepad. A 3D model of the bronchial structure was created using Blender. The model was then exported as a wavefront object (obj file). The model was then imported into Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and populated with interest points which project Heads Up Display (HUD) widgets containing information regarding CF and its effects on the lungs. The objective is for the user to operate this novel approach in education to view the effects the mucus has on the lungs by locating and interacting with each interest point. Interactions at these interest points include watching short 3D animations, reading textual information, listening to breathing sounds affected by the mucus, and using inhaled antibiotics to reduce the mucus in the airways. This system has yet to be tested, however it is anticipated that it's novel approach will prove advantageous in an outreach program and innovative strategy to encouraging CF physiotherapy adherence.},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This case study examines students' affective responses to and relationships with two-dimensional (2D) and 360{$^\circ$} videos that were experienced with or without low-cost virtual reality (VR) headsets. Background: The prior research on low-cost VR technology is scant. Schools and universities are not financially able to purchase tens or hundreds of expensive inbuilt VR headsets. Therefore, we recommend an alternative, low-cost solution.  Methodology: We conducted the experiment with students' (N=100) responses to videos and VR technologies used in a higher education setting. We also applied a quantitative research approach examined in light of media richness and affective experience theories. Contribution: This study provides evidence of the integral role that VR technologies and 360{$^\circ$} video content play, because using low-cost VR headsets potentially decreases the initial affective experiences of 360{$^\circ$} videos among students. Although VR headsets improve media richness, they might simultaneously weaken students' overall affective experiences if they experience usability challenges. Findings: The results showed that using low-cost VR headsets decreased positive user experiences when they were watching 360{$^\circ$} videos. The 360{$^\circ$} video experience was noted to be better without low-cost VR headsets. Low-cost VR headsets with a smartphone and 360{$^\circ$} videos were found to be complicated to set up and use among first-time users. However, 360{$^\circ$} videos created a more positive affect than did 2D videos. We also found that the positive affect of videos enhanced the social sharing intention. Recommendations for Practitioners: Educational institutes and teachers with limited financial budgets need to plan and manage courses that increases their need to adopt low-cost VR headsets. However, a poor initial user experience of low-cost VR technology usability might create negative student attitudes, which might hinder VR's adoption rate in higher education.  Recommendation for Researchers: This study provides a new understanding about students' affective experiences of 2D videos and 360{$^\circ$} videos with and without low-cost VR headsets. The results show that positive user experiences of 2D and 360{$^\circ$} videos enhance students' interest in sharing and collaboration in digital learning environments.  Impact on Society: The results help educators to predict possible usability challenges in selecting the proper rich media for different learning situations. Additionally, the results assist educators to design VR assisted courses that motivate students. Future Research: The experimental comparison of different VR solutions and traditional learning technologies merits further examination. Additionally, more research is needed to determine the relationship of VR technologies, video content and learning methods, because technological features and content are tightly integrated in VR.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The efficacy of agricultural set-aside policies for protecting farmland biodiversity is widely debated. Based on a meta-analysis of 127 published studies, we found that land withdrawn from conventional production unequivocally enhances biodiversity in North America and Europe. The number of species of birds, insects, spiders, and plants is 1--1.5 standard deviation units higher on set-aside land, and population densities increase by 0.5--1 standard deviation units. Set-aside land may be especially beneficial for desirable taxa because North American bird species that have exhibited population declines react most positively to set-aside agricultural land. Larger and older plots protect more species and higher densities, and set-aside land is more effective in countries with less-intensive agricultural practices and higher fractions of land removed from production. Although policies specifically designed to protect biodiversity might work even better, current incentives clearly improve the standing of plants and animals in farmland.},

  abstract = {Gonadal distribution in 409 cases of human true hermaphroditism is reviewed. An ovary was found on the left side of the body in 62.8\% of the cases and the testis on the right side in 59.5\%. The ovotestis is the most common gonad of the true hermaphrodite; amongst 806 gonads in 406 cases it was found in 44.3\%. In this paper we give a detailed description of the morphology of ovotestis, testis and ovary in the true hermaphrodite. In addition we discuss the effects of fetal androgens and Mtillerian inhibiting factor on the Wolffian and Mfillerian ducts. Correlations between chromosomal complement and gonadal distribution are presented. True hermaphrodites with a 46,XX karyotype most commonly have an ovary on one side and an ovotestis on the other side; those with a Y-chromosome have a testis in 61\% of cases. An analysis of the ratio of ovarian and testicular tissue within ovotestes showed a continuum from very little ovarian tissue to a small portion of testicular tissue. Each type of tissue was clearly demarcated. Hypotheses for gonadal induction in the true hermaphrodite should take cognizance of these facts. True hermaphrodites with a 46,XX chromosomal complement were characterized by a male phenotype in 54\% of cases. This group may suggest a greater testicular induction ability in the genome as compared to the 46\% with a female phenotype.},

In this paper, the capabilities of different computational software for designing VR applications in engineering education are discussed. As a result, a general flowchart is proposed as a guide for designing VR resources in any application. It is worth highlighting that, rather than this study being based on the applications used in the engineering field, the obtained results can be easily extrapolated to other knowledge areas without any loss of generality. This way, this paper can serve as a guide for creating a VR application.},

The students developed a geometric design of a road that was posteriorly modeled in 3D and provided in simulator. Students piloted a vehicle in the immersive simulator in the same road that they designed. Subsequently the usability of the system was assessed by the SUS metric (System Usability Scale). We performed an evaluation with 52 users and the SUS metric that we found was of 73\% assuring a degree of usability above average and demonstrating that the immersive system is good to be used as a complementary tool in the learning of transport infrastructure.},

Gamification is used to engage students in the learning process. This study adds learning methodologies like Learning by Doing to students' collaborative work, and mixes teacher support with new, accessible technology, such as virtual reality and visualization 3D on the web thanks to webGL. This creates a new management tool, called GLABS, to assist in the gamification of the classroom. Understanding the role of gamification and the technology in education means understanding under what circumstances game elements can drive a student's learning behavior so that he or she may achieve better results in the learning process.},

In this autoethnography, the author explores the state of understanding regarding autoethnography as a research method and describes the experience of an emerging qualitative researcher in learning about this new and ideologically challenging genre of inquiry.},

This chapter addresses these challenges by providing an analysis of game genres, learning paradigms, theories and models used in different AR games in the field of education. Hence, we present a selected number of previous studies of AR games in the field of education, which are classified by year of publication, school subject, research method, game genres, AR systems, learning environment, learning paradigms and theories, target group(s) and study sample size. The classified data is analysed to identify how AR games designed based on diverse game genres can be used to benefit the educational process in the context of different theoretical paradigms and models used in learning.},

For all diverse application areas, it is essential to understand the user's condition to ensure a safe, pleasant, and meaningful VR experience. However, VR experience evaluation is still in its infancy. The present paper takes up this research desideratum by conflating diverse expertise and learnings about experience evaluation in general and VR experiences in particular into a systematic evaluation framework (               appRaiseVR               ).                                         Method               . To capture diverse expertise, we conducted two focus groups (bottom-up approach) with experts working in different fields of experience evaluation (e.\,g., Movie Experience, Theatre Experiences). First, we clustered the results of both focus groups. Then, we conflated those results and the learnings about experience evaluation stemming from the field of user experience into the final framework (top-down approach).                                         Results               . The framework includes five steps providing high-level guidance through the VR evaluation process. The first three steps support the definition of the experience and evaluation conditions (               setting, level, plausibility               ). The last two steps guide the selection to find an appropriate               time course               and               tools of measure               .                                         Conclusion               .               appRaiseVR               offers high-level guidance for evaluators with different expertise and contexts. Finally, establishing similar evaluation procedures might contribute to safe, pleasant, and meaningful VR experiences.},

  abstract = {In collaboration with doctors and medical students a novel ophthalmology training solution based upon virtual reality (VR) and gamification was developed. Fifteen fourth year medical students at Birmingham City Hospital (UK) helped evaluate it. Evaluations were based upon the Technology Acceptance Model and related to how well users learnt to use the app, their satisfaction with it; if it helped them learn ophthalmology and their view on the teaching approach used within it. Responses were rated on a five point Likert scale (completely agreed to completely disagree). Results represent those that agreed or completely agreed with the questions. Students agreed they could easily learn how to use the app (n:14) and it was clear how to use (n:15). The feedback systems supported both this (n:11) as well as learning how to perform eye examinations (n:13). Users felt the app improved their understanding of the processes involved in ophthalmology (n: 14); their ability to recognize main landmarks of the eye (n:14) and abnormalities (n:15). They felt the app would give them confidence to perform eye examinations on patients in future (n:12) and it would increase other students' confidence too (n: 15). Users found the app enjoyable to use (n:15); would use it in future (n:13) and would like to learn other clinical skills in this way (n:15). A rigorous User-Centred approach has been used to successfully develop a novel ophthalmology training tool. The approach used will help inform others interested in developing VR educational tools.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) offline cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

  abstract = {Constructing a valid measure of presence and discovering the factors that contribute to presence have been much sought after goals of presence researchers and at times have generated controversy among them. This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

The existing methods are not suitable to be applied directly in the mobile AR system for the built environment, with the reasons of poor real-time performance and robustness. This paper proposes an improved 3D registration method of mobile AR for built environment, which is based on SURFREAK and KLT. This method increases the building efficiency of algorithm descriptors and maintains the robustness of the algorithms. To implement and evaluate the registration method, a smart phone-based mobile AR system for built environment is developed. The experimental result shows that the improved method is endowed with higher real-time performance and robustness, and the mobile AR 3D registration can realize a favorable performance and efficiency in the complex built environment. The mobile AR system could be used in building recognition and information augmentation for built environment and further to facilitate location-based games, urban heritage tourism, urban planning, and smart city.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for a Forest Ranger Game by applying virtual reality into it together with other classical learning techniques, to motivate the students and increase their learning performance. The implementation of a serious game has been included as this game not only to attract students into gamification learning but also creates awareness towards illegal logging. In addition, based on Bloom's taxonomy theory there will be a focus on application of increased student cognitive thinking by teaching and requiring high order thinking skills, especially from the analysis to creation level. Game based learning can be seen from the perspective of learning theories to invoke and underpin educational computer game design and use based on the four types of learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism. These new findings can enhance the results of previous studies with regard to the issue of learning-theory foundations in game-based learning. The contributions of this study for the issue of learning-theory foundations in gamebased learning are discussed.

  abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) holds great potential for learning, but it is unclear how VR experiences should be designed to maximize learning potential. In this study, we explored how the level of interactivity in an educational VR storytelling experience for immunology learning affects a user's learning gains. We created three versions of the VR experience with low (system automates as many actions as possible), medium (a combination of system automation and user-controlled actions), and high (as many user-controlled actions as possible) levels of interactivity. We hypothesized that too much or too little interactivity would result in smaller learning gains than a medium level of interactivity. Although data from pre and post-tests showed no significant difference in students' learning gains due to interactivity level, questionnaire and interview data suggest that interactivity in the experience significantly affects students' engagement in learning, attention, and focus on learning material. Participants also perceived that they could learn better and more effectively in a VR experience with a higher level of interactivity.},

  abstract = {Soil-biodegradable plastic mulches (BDMs) are made from biodegradable materials that can be bio-based, synthetic, or a blend of these two types of polymers, which are designed to degrade in soil through microbial activities. The purpose of BDMs is to reduce agricultural plastic waste by replacing polyethylene (PE) mulch, which is not biodegradable. Most studies have evaluated the breakdown of BDMs within annual production systems, but knowledge of BDM breakdown in perennial systems is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the deterioration and degradation of BDMs in a commercial red raspberry (Rubus ideaus L.) production system. Deterioration was low ({$\leq$}11\% percent soil exposure; PSE) for all mulches until October 2017 (five months after transplanting, MAT). By March 2018 (10 MAT), deterioration reached 91\% for BDMs but remained low for PE mulch (4\%). Mechanical strength also was lower for BDMs than PE mulch. In a soil burial test in the raspberry field, 91\% of the BDM area remained after 18 months. In-soil BDM degradation was minimal, although the PSE was high. Since mulch is only applied once in a perennial crop production system, and the lifespan of the planting may be three or more years, it is worth exploring the long-term degradation of BDMs in perennial cropping systems across diverse environments.},

  abstract = {Immersive technologies have the potential to overcome physical limitations and virtually deliver field site experiences, for example, into the classroom. Yet, little is known about the features of immersive technologies that contribute to successful place-based learning. Immersive technologies afford embodied experiences by mimicking natural embodied interactions through a user's egocentric perspective. Additionally, they allow for beyond reality experiences integrating contextual information that cannot be provided at actual field sites. The current study singles out one aspect of place-based learning: Scale. In an empirical evaluation, scale was manipulated as part of two immersive virtual field trip (iVFT) experiences in order to disentangle its effect on place-based learning. Students either attended an actual field trip (AFT) or experienced one of two iVFTs using a headmounted display. The iVFTs either mimicked the actual field trip or provided beyond reality experiences offering access to the field site from an elevated perspective using pseudo-aerial 360{$^\circ$} imagery. Results show that students with access to the elevated perspective had significantly better scores, for example, on their spatial situation model (SSM). Our findings provide first results on how an increased (geographic) scale, which is accessible through an elevated perspective, boosts the development of SSMs. The reported study is part of a larger immersive education effort. Inspired by the positive results, we discuss our plan for a more rigorous assessment of scale effects on both self- and objectively assessed performance measures of spatial learning.},

Secondly, various factors were determined that influenced the effect of serious game assisted learning. The major section identified both advantages and disadvantages of use of serious games in education. Use of serious games in medical science has been rising in a recent decade, which is thus highlighted in this study. Attitudes toward use of serious games in education were explored, as well as the new development of use of serious games in education. Future theoretical and practical exploration might need interdisciplinary cooperation.},

However, current learning theories and models either mainly take into account the technology perspectives, or focus more on the pedagogy. In this paper, we propose a learning model benefiting from both the Human-Computer Interaction aspects and pedagogical aspects. This model takes full account of the impact of different factors including pedagogical contexts, VR roles and scenarios, and output specifications, which would be combined to inform the design and realize VR education applications. Based on this model, we design and implement an educational application of computer assembly under virtual reality using HTC Vive, which is a headset providing immersion experience. To analyze users' learning behaviors and evaluate their performance and experience, we conduct an evaluation with 32 college students as participants. We design a questionnaire including usability tests and emotion state measures. Results showed that our proposed learning model gave a good guidance for informing the design and use of VR-supported learning application. The use of the natural interaction not only makes the learning interesting and fosters the engagement, but also improves the construction of knowledge in practices.},
